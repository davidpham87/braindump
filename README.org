* Why?

- Using [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam][org-roam]], [[https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/][mkdocs-material]], I can generate a website to search for my
  idea, using the zettelkasten methods.
- Org mode is great for authoring, but I do prefer some nice font and a good
  navigation, search navigation. mkdocs-material offered a great compromise and
  orgmk allowed me to have a command line conversion.
- [[id:9336fa0f-85f3-4943-b374-6ca2f01ee0f8][Clojure]] allowed to handle all the files systems, interaction with the sqlite
  database, the parsing and the concurrency.
- I came up with my own set up, cards for writing anything that goes into my
  minds, links them and decks for writing summaries. Blog posts are a place
  where I can write some ideas and opinions to share them.

** Technical challenge

I created some functions to leverage the ~org-roam.db~ sqlite data base. With
my own starting template, the code reads the tags and the links, such that
automatic see also are created at the end of each page.

See org-roam-clj on how to use the library.

** Small index for quick access
