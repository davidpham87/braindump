* Why Clojure?

  - Simplicity and concision (factor of 5 to 10), transparence.
  - Information driven (work with data).
  - Novelty of Lisp and functional programming.
  - Better at design
  - Macros, consumption, at change of paradigm
  - Immutable
  - Functions
  - Reach (jvm, js, python)
  - Concurrency and parallelism
  - Reference type and why
  - Testing

   I would say it is not just a list of things but how all of them combine
   together to create a unique experience. For me, the main advantages are the
   following:

   - Amazing immutable data structures :: When all values are immutable, you don't
     have to think about a lot of things you have to think when you are programming
     in other languages.

   - Great set of general functions ::  working on all of these via the unified
     sequence abstraction. I have never seen anything like this.

   - The language :: it is unusual but when you spend some time with it, it is really
     simple There are no surprises, no strange syntax, on overloading of meaning. I
     can't say this for any other language I have ever used: C++, Java, Python, ...

   - REPL :: is live changing. A lot of languages nowadays have something they
     call REPL, giving you the illusion it is the same. Clojure REPL is a
     completely different beast. It is not just a quick console to test pieces
     of your code, for which it is even better, since its output is again a
     code. In Clojure, you get rid of the life-sucking compile-test
     loop. Instead you compile your program once and you run it while
     developing and testing. At any moment, you can investigate the state while
     manipulating the program, write new functionality and immediately see
     whether it works, etc.

   The combination of Clojure and ClojureScript is amazing because now you can
   target everything with one language.
