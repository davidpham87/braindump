** Some ideas which are almost good

   #+begin_quote
   Potemkin is a collection of facades and workarounds for things that are more
   difficult than they should be. All functions are within the potemkin namespace.
   #+end_quote

   The important function is =impots-vars=, it allows to define variable in one
   namespace and expose them in another.
