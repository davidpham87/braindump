* Docker and Kubernete
  Docker are containers/processes which can be considered as lightweight VMs.
  Kuberenetes (K8s) are container orchestration. They allow for load balancing
  (2 level with ingress (external load balancing) and service (internal load
  balancer)) on pods (docker containers). They allow for recover from failure
  for resource, and rolling update.

* DevOPS
  Learn about ansible (again).
