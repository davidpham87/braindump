** Properties

   Taking from [[file:20200430155637-applied_clojure.org][Applied Clojure]]

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   We are looking for /invariants/ -- properties that are always true. [...]
   mathematical laws, relationships between inputs and outputs, round-trip or
   complementing functions, and comparing action effects.

   Properties like identity, associativity, commutativity and idempotency are
   an excellent place to start.
   #+END_QUOTE

   Other general properties:

   - membership is not modified (frequencies of element still are the same),
     maybe distinct for sets and hash-map.
   - Trusted implementation. Compare the results and calculation on a trusted
     different implementation (different language, slower/faster version). For
     stateful components (like database), apply same logical operation on a
     logical model correct implementation like hash-map or vectors
     (e.g. =create= is =assoc=, =delete= is =dissoc=).
   - Avoid to implement again the same algorithms.
   - Commutativity of operations

** How to specify it

   Talk about how to specify properties for pure functions.

   - Invariant :: things that ought to be always true.
   - Optimize for correctness in the assertion, not for performance (test case
     are usually small).
   - Make sure that generator are also valid.

   - Postcondition :: Asking what is the postcondition? Finding what ought to be true after
     the function call.
   - If the properties requires to have the function under test, create a
     generator that insures that the state is consistent (for example, in a
     hash-map, for testing =contains?=, you can insert and remove key to test the
     properties of =contains?=).

   - Metamorphic properties :: instead of predicting and test the result from
     an input, predict and test the relationship of result from two almost
     input. It is the idea of paths for getting to a final state. The
     relationship could be equality, size comparison. You can also check
     equivalence on result (as function of the result).  You have to change in
     terms of the space of continuous functions: if input change, how will the
     change on the image be $\Delta f = f(x+\delta) - f(x)$? Some write
     metamorphic relations.

   - Inductive properties :: argument by induction that only the correct
     function can pass the test (using recursion). Double check the conformity
     by applying operations that should also keep the result valid.

   - Model-based properties :: similar to trusted implementation by working on
     a abstraction function with an abstraction operation. The assumption is
     you can convert your result into the abstraction and applying the same
     operations on the abstraction (you have an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism][homomorphism]]).

   Model-based properties is one of the most powerful representation. However,
   the model based properties can look too alike than the implementation or the
   function under test. If you feel you write too much code on the model based
   version, switch to metamorphic properties do not require on a model (and
   they are easier to write with good effectiveness). Invariant properties
   should be first because they are the most fundamental.
