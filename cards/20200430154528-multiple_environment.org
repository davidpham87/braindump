** Multiple environments
   - We can have different class paths for configuration with =clj= and alias
     in =deps.edn= to manage them.
   - Proxies: you add in ~.shadow-cljs/config.edn or in the config file

   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
     {:maven {:proxy {:host "proxy.host.com" :port 8080}}}
   #+END_SRC
