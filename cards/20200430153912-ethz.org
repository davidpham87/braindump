*** DONE Causality [2/2]

I had 5.75 (kind of deserved).
- PDAG: Partially means no directed cycle whereas DAG means no cycle at all.
  CPDAG (Markov Equivalent Graphs): for every directed node, all graph have the
  same edge. For undirected edges, there exist at least two graphs with
  opposite direction of the edge.  Markov equivalent if they have the same
  skeleton and immoralities (v-struct).
- D-separation $\to$ Blocked Reverse engineer the definition by thinking about
  the independence
- Markov blanket $M$: for a target node $Y$, it is smallest set $M$ of nodes in
  the graphs that make $Y$ independent of all the other nodes given $M$. In
  DAG: for $X$ it contains its parents, its children and the parents of
  children.
- Causal minimality: $P^X$ is not markov to any proper subgraph of
  $\mathcal{G}$ if and only if there are no useless edge.
- Markov: conditional d-sep $\Rightarrow$ independence, faithfulness is the
  converse. Local: $X$ is independent of any non descendent given its parnets.
- Adjustment formula (tautology): the conditional probability given the parents
  remains the same under the interventions.
- The goal adjustment set: evaluate interventions or causality with
  observational data.
- Valid adjustment set $Z$: $p_{\mathcal{S}, do(X=x)}(y) = \sum_{z \in Z}
  p_{\mathcal{S}}(y \vert X=x, z) p(z)$ for $y$ not in the parent of $x$ and
  $x, y \notin Z$.
- Backdoor criterion: $S$ blocks all paths from $X$ to $Y$ that come
  \emph{into} $X$ (backward path) and $S$ contains no descendant of $X$.
