  ClojureScript (cljs) lead developer

** Defn episode 60

   - React achieve a local maximum in UI development. Functional way of
     creating UI (25 years after MVC). Change will be incremental from now on
     probably.
   - =:bundle= target in cljs allows to defer packaging problem to building
     tools from javascript.
   - dart might be used a future target for clojurescript.

** Rethinking Identity with Clojure

   - Clojure specs is data specification mechanism and can be shared between
     programs. It complex constructor and type (type checking on the language
     construct, the constructor) [whereas we can share specifications]. The set
     of specifications (the body of specification) can be used everywhere.
   - Find the sources of complexity. Designing and simplify concepts by keeping
     independents one separate.
   - Complexity will be felt all the way down to the user and provides a bad
     UX.
   - Hyperledger fabric for block chain.
   - Rich Hickey is a good way for learning decomplicting.
