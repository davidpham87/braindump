* General
  + Learn with https://www.hackerrank.com/ (especially Clojure).
    Complete some harder problems in functional programming.
  + www.pythonchallenge.com
  * Exercise
** TODO Read introduction to elisp
** TODO Diff, ediff
   - =a= or =b= to select which version is correct. Append =x= for saving.
   - In magit, use =e= for diffing with ediff.
** magit and git, gitimmersion
   + [X] Revert file in magit
   + [ ] Read introduction
** Master/read manual org-mode
   * org-mode easy template (e.g. =<s[tab]=) allows to easily include org
     syntax. =C-c C-,= to open the shortcut window.
   * =C-c C-q= (insert tags), =C-c /= (filter org-file by).
** Rewrite emacs.d through org-mode and usepackage.
   It would be good to get a unified version of my *.emacs.d* with org files and
   usepackage.

** Dired mode
   - Find files with grep
   - Still have to learn the new shortcuts. Most important are =R=, =C=, =D=, =(=, =%
     m= and =% g0.
   - Using =Q=, empower the user to query and replace in files. Using =* u= to
     select all non-saved buffer to close them all.
** Perfect use of keyboard [2/2]
   - [X] The comma should be hit with the middle finger.
   - [X] Emacs keybindings should be used using both hands, this has to be set with key-bindings.
   - Tip: use the hand palm for reaching the CTRL keys.
   - [ ]: balance the space between the hand. Especially the right thumb as
     most words in english finish with the left hand letters.
** Write a script to update my-emacs-config automatically.
   Best way would be to use git. Used a fork of emacs-live.

** DONE Remap C-c C-z to C-c C-y for Swiss Keyboards, for terminal switching.
** DONE Emmet in Emacs, with HAML filter in the json snippet.
   HAML is automatic in emacs. However, the key bindings need to be remapped
   as the usage of `C-j` is too much widespread.
** DONE Cppcheck
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/styleguide/gh-pages/cpplint/cpplint.py
   sudo mv cpplint.py /usr/local/bin/cpplint.py
   sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/cpplint.py
   #+END_SRC
   Also uncomment the following
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (custom-set-variables
     '(flycheck-c/c++-googlelint-executable "/usr/local/bin/cpplint.py"))
   #+END_SRC
   in =cpp-settings.el=.
** DONE Aspell
   Set dictionary in French and German.
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   sudo apt-get install aspell-fr aspell-de
   #+END_SRC
** Go to char (avy-goto-word-or-subword-1)
   In prelude ~"C-c j"~ and then ~char~ jumps to a given character in the buffer.

** Deft ignore file regex
   Set =deft-ignore-file-regexp= [2020-05-06 Mi].

** Regex in search
   For grouping you need to escape the parenthesis.
