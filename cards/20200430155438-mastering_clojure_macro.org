* Mastering Clojure Macro
  - Macro is about manipulating the arguments of your functions before they
    get evaluated. We should think about templating when thinking about
    macros.
  - The macro returns a S-Expression which should be valid Clojure code.
  - Use =`= for namespace quoting everything after the backquote (usually a
    list). Unquote is done through =~=. Unquote splicing =~@= allows to
    remove the parenthesis in a list and put them at the same level as the
    parent S-Expression. For example the following =`(1 2 ~@(3 4) 5)`=
    returns =(1 2 3 4 5)=.
  - Whenever we need to bind a symbol in a macro (e.g =fn= and =let=), the
    argument should be gensym, or symbol appended of a =#=, e.g =x#=.
  - =&form= [the calling expression] and =&env= [the binding environment] are
    special values only available in macros.
  - Disadvantage with macros. Macros are not values (as they are not
    functions). So we can't use =map= or any other function on them. Macros
    can be contagious as they can leak force your user to also write macros
    to use your library. They can be tough to get right (mainly because of
    side effect and computation time). We should avoid doing a mess in our
    user namespace whenever writing macros.
  - Macros are useful to evaluate code in Context. When using dynamic binding,
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (declare ^:dynamic *radius*)
      (defn circle-area []
        (* Math/PI (* *radius* *radius*)))
      (binding [*radius* 10]
        (circle-area))
    #+END_SRC
    it can be useful to abstract the binding step with a macro. Most common
    bindings are for =*out*=. In general, we should have the core of the
    manipulation of a macro written in a function, and have the smallest
    possible amount of lines of code into a the macro.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (defn with-out-file-fn [file body-fn]
        (with-open [writer (clojure.java.io/writer file :append true)]
          (binding [*out* writer]
            (body-fn))))

      (defn with-out-file [file & body]
        `(with-out-file-fn ~file
           (fn [] ~@body)))
    #+END_SRC
    Macro can also decide how we evaluate (or not) the input, e.g. =comment=.
    A cool trick for a function that should be executed only once
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (let [x :a
            f (^:once fn* [] (println x))]
        (f)  ;; prints :a
        (f)) ;; prints nil
    #+END_SRC
    Macros can also rescuing errors and clean up resources. The main point is
    macros allow to eliminate noisy details of cleaning up an open resource,
    rescuing errors, or setting up dynamic bindings or other context for
    evaluation. It allows to abstract away the contextual details and core
    operations can be clarified to make the purpose of the code more obvious.
  - Optimization. Before optimizing, we should know how to
    benchmark. =criterium.core= is a nice solution for that. Macros can let
    write type hinting without the users being noticed and as the computation
    is done at compile time, they allow optimization of operations or
    functions which does not depend on user input.
  - Macro can build apis that say what they mean. It allows to avoid
    unnecessary intermediary steps for the users to know, especially ones
    that require forms that are not essentials to the API. For example,
    building resources or calling functions. In this case, we should try to
    have as much operations in functions, to avoid bugs but also to offer the
    choice to the user to call functions (which are values) or macros.
  - As macro execute the logic of its body before executing its arguments, we
    can bend the control flow of our code. The lowest level of looping in
    Clojure is the =loop/recur= construction and most control flow in Clojure
    are derived from this. This is a special case of creating languages
    features.
