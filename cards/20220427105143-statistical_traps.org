* Statistical Traps

This is my own summary of chapter 45 from [[http://www.intuitivebiostatistics.com/][Intuitive Biostatistics]].

1. Focusing on /p-values/ and statistical significance rather than effect size.
   - Focus on the size of effect (it should be big enough to be of interest).
   - Is the effect determined with sufficient precision.
2. Testing hypotheses suggested by the data (known as /HARKING/) or data leaking.
3. Analyzing withoutt a plan (/p-hacking/), problem of multiple comparison, and
   power of tests.
4. Correlation does not prove causation.
5.
