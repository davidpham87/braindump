* TOOD List

  This Todo file is a simple example of what I still have to learn or do. These
  are the goals I would like to reach or interest me.

* Highly important

** Read
   - how to write notes efficiently.
   - org journal, org-roam-server.
   - git subrepositories (for multiple projects).
   - Check how org gather indices properties.
   - pods in babashka.

** Write
   - Simple made easy
   - test.check and generative testing

** Idea
   - Check sha1 in converting org files (because it is super slow otherwise) org-roam-clj
   - Download clojure.core and use materiala for testing. [[file:cards/20200503165952-materiala.org][Materiala]]
   - Fork marginalia parser and correct its bug: [[https://github.com/gdeer81/marginalia/blob/master/src/marginalia/parser.clj][parser]]

** Goals
   - specs, core.async, datomic, testing.
   - Kubernetes, container technology.
   - Webworkers and websockets.
   - GPU computing
   - GraphQL
   - Spark
   - Kafka
   - Learn about databases (postgres, elastic search and datomic).
   - SICP, Read data science and algorithm manual.

** TODO Read Advanced Data Analysis from an elementary point of view
   [[http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/][Advanced data analysis from an elementary point of view]]

** Multipass and Ansible
   Use multipass and Ansible to simulate networks and kubernetes.

** Learn CSS
   - Write a summary (check create of Bulma)
   - [[https://github.com/clj-commons/cljss][cljss]], [[https://github.com/manutter51/woolybear][woolybear]]

** Leverage indices and org-parser
   - Check whether we can use indices to create better indexing.
   - Use pods and sqlite to leverage on the org-roam and extend it to markdown.
