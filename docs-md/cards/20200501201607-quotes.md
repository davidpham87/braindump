These quote are attributed to Einstein but I am not convinced.

## Education

## Life Style

These are inspirational philosophy [but not empirically approved in class room].

> Growth mindset is about meaningful and purposed efforts. &#x2013; Carol DWECK

> Grit is passion and sustained persistence applied toward long-term achievement, with no particular concern for rewards or recognition along the way. &#x2013; Angela DUCKWORTH

Deliberated practice is the key to mastery.
