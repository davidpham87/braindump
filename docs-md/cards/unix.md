-   [x] find command: options are: `-name ("*.cpp" or ".c")`,
    `-type (f, d)`, `-mtime`, use `+/-[:digit:]` for saying "more or
    less \[:digit:\] time", escaped parentheses `\( \)`,
    `-a(nd) or -o(r) ! (negation)`. The `-exec` option passes the result
    to the following instruction (like ls -s) with `{} \;` for the place
    holder of the find results.
