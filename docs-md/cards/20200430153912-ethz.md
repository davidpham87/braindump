### <span class="done DONE">DONE</span> Causality \[2/2\]

I had 5.75 (kind of deserved).

-   PDAG: Partially means no directed cycle whereas DAG means no cycle
    at all. CPDAG (Markov Equivalent Graphs): for every directed node,
    all graph have the same edge. For undirected edges, there exist at
    least two graphs with opposite direction of the edge. Markov
    equivalent if they have the same skeleton and immoralities
    (v-struct).
-   D-separation → Blocked Reverse engineer the definition by thinking
    about the independence
-   Markov blanket *M*: for a target node *Y*, it is smallest set *M* of
    nodes in the graphs that make *Y* independent of all the other nodes
    given *M*. In DAG: for *X* it contains its parents, its children and
    the parents of children.
-   Causal minimality: *P*<sup>*X*</sup> is not markov to any proper
    subgraph of 𝒢 if and only if there are no useless edge.
-   Markov: conditional d-sep ⇒ independence, faithfulness is the
    converse. Local: *X* is independent of any non descendent given its
    parnets.
-   Adjustment formula (tautology): the conditional probability given
    the parents remains the same under the interventions.
-   The goal adjustment set: evaluate interventions or causality with
    observational data.
-   Valid adjustment set *Z*:
    *p*<sub>𝒮, *d**o*(*X*=*x*)</sub>(*y*) = ∑<sub>*z* ∈ *Z*</sub>*p*<sub>𝒮</sub>(*y*\|*X*=*x*,*z*)*p*(*z*)
    for *y* not in the parent of *x* and *x*, *y* ∉ *Z*.
-   Backdoor criterion: *S* blocks all paths from *X* to *Y* that come
    *into* *X* (backward path) and *S* contains no descendant of *X*.
