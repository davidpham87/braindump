# Webapp Testing

## Strategies

  - Pure functions, use generative testing and test cards, these are
    easy to write, but requires careful design from the author. At best,
    pure functions should be written in cljc, as they could be run in
    jvm.
  - Devcards or storybook offers visual unit tests
  - E2E testing leverages on javascript infrastructure. See taiko,
    cypress.
  - Generative testing and another choice would be to record all the
    events the states and tests and leverage on google chrome protocols
    to listen for errors.

## Snooping API Calls

  - Use [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org) to spy on your API calls from
    your devices.
  - Use ifconfig to check your machines IPs.

## Chrome Devtools Protocol

You must lunch a browser with remote debugging port

``` shell
google-chrome-stable --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=remote-profile
```

Using
[clj-chrome-devtools](https://github.com/tatut/clj-chrome-devtools), you
can listen to `events` from the browser.

``` clojure
(ns user
  (:require
   [clojure.core.async :as a]
   [clj-chrome-devtools.commands.log :as cdp-log]
   [clj-chrome-devtools.commands.runtime :as runtime]
   [clj-chrome-devtools.core :refer (connect)]
   [clj-chrome-devtools.events :refer (listen)]))

(def c (connect "localhost" 9222))
(def chan-console (listen c :runtime :console-api-called))

(a/go-loop []
  (let [x (a/<! chan-console)]
    (when x
      (println x)
      (recur))))

(runtime/evaluate c {:expression "3 + 5"}) ;; you can evaluate expressions
(runtime/evaluate c {:expression "1/0"}) ;; you should see an error
```
