# Webapp Testing

## Strategies

-   Pure functions, use generative testing and test cards, these are
    easy to write, but requires careful design from the author. At best,
    pure functions should be written in cljc, as they could be run in
    jvm.
-   Devcards or storybook offers visual unit tests
-   E2E testing leverages on javascript infrastructure. See taiko,
    cypress.
-   Generative testing and another choice would be to record all the
    events the states and tests and leverage on google chrome protocols
    to listen for errors.

## Snooping API Calls

-   Use [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org) to spy on your API calls from
    your devices.
-   Use ifconfig to check your machines IPs.

## Chrome Devtools Protocol

You must lunch a browser with remote debugging port

``` shell
google-chrome-stable --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=remote-profile
```

Using
[clj-chrome-devtools](https://github.com/tatut/clj-chrome-devtools), you
can listen to `events` from the browser.

``` clojure
(ns user
  (:require
   [clojure.core.async :as a]
   [clj-chrome-devtools.commands.log :as cdp-log]
   [clj-chrome-devtools.commands.runtime :as runtime]
   [clj-chrome-devtools.core :refer (connect)]
   [clj-chrome-devtools.events :refer (listen)]))

(def c (connect "localhost" 9222))
(def chan-console (listen c :runtime :console-api-called))
;; (def chan-console-error (listen c :runtime :exception-thrown)) This is the other important domain and event

(a/go-loop []
  (let [x (a/<! chan-console)]
    (when x
      (println x)
      (recur))))

(runtime/evaluate c {:expression "3 + 5"}) ;; you can evaluate expressions
(runtime/evaluate c {:expression "1/0"}) ;; you should see an error
```

## Re-frame and CDP

The problem is whenever the state of the application is valid, but the
web browser is not. End to end testing is the process of replicating the
user interaction with the application in order to test its behavior. My
biggest feat is when the application enters an error mode from which the
user can't recover. Normally, this situation should be caught at
development time, however, as the code base grows and the code base more
coupled, it is worth to develop a test suite in which we trust.

As much as unit testing is helpful to keep regression and verify some
correctness properties, I found end-to-end (e2e) testing more appealing
and worthy of my time, as they replicate my manual testing process with
the browser.

There are many contenders in the domain (pupeeter and taiko for
example), but my biggest hurdle with these solutions is they assume you
don't have any control on the event system of the application: they
force the tester to interact with finding the application by finding the
right UI field and the right button and start inputing there.

Instead of finding the node and interacting with it, it would be much
more interesting to dispatch re-frame events, and listen to the browser
for any thrown errors.

The advantage is the reuse (or creation) the state machine interaction
and the generation of user interaction travel.

The disadvantage is obviously testing speed, as we need to wait for
events to render and possibly a lot of noise. It is awefuly slow.
Moreover, some dispatched events might never be dispatched by users as
they might not be able interact with the UI part. But, it allows you to
replicate your manual testing process, which gives some confidence.

### Strategy

The strategy is to create a `test` module in our clojurescript app in
which several testing functions are defined, running a chrome devtools
protocol process which will call the test functions in a test browser.

The necessary steps are to adjust the shadow-cljs configuration, adding
the module to the `html` in CDP, and call the export test function.

## Playwright with nbbjs

Playwright (a fork of puppeteer) could be used in conjunction with nbbjs
(a clojure repl with only node as dependency) to make \`e2e\` call as
well. The advantage is the usage of premade containers, easing the
deployment of the solution.
