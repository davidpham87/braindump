# ClojureCuda


## Installation

Insure that the paths are updated at the end of your `.bashrc` file

```sh
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

The version minor version of the cuda library also matter. You also need to simlink the exact `libnvrt.so.MAJOR.MINOR` binary into `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/`. For example

```shell
ln -s /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libnvrtc.so.11.0 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
```
