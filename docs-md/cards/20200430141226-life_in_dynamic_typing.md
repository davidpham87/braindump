# Life In Dynamic Typing

In dynamic typed language, assertions are used often to check assumption
of your input data. In Clojure the `:pre` and `:post` conditions can be
used effectively to fill this purpose.

``` clojure
(defn f [x]
  {:pre [(integer? x)]
   :post string?}
  (str x))
```

`{:elide-asserts true}` in production build compiler options to remove
`:pre` and `:post` assertions in your code.
