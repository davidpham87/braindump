# Docker and Kubernete

Docker are containers/processes which can be considered as lightweight
VMs. Kuberenetes (K8s) are container orchestration. They allow for load
balancing (2 level with ingress (external load balancing) and service
(internal load balancer)) on pods (docker containers). They allow for
recover from failure for resource, and rolling update.

Podman, with podman-compose and buildah are alternative to docker and
docker-compose.
