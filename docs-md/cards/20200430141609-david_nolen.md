ClojureScript (cljs) lead developer


## Defn episode 60

-   React achieve a local maximum in UI development. Functional way of creating UI (25 years after MVC). Change will be incremental from now on probably.
-   `:bundle` target in cljs allows to defer packaging problem to building tools from javascript.

## Rethinking Identity with Clojure

-   Clojure specs is data specification mechanism and can be shared between programs. It complex constructor and type (type checking on the language construct, the constructor) [whereas we can share specifications]. The set of specifications (the body of specification) can be used everywhere.
-   Find the sources of complexity. Designing and simplify concepts by keeping independents one separate.
-   Complexity will be felt all the way down to the user and provides a bad UX.
-   Hyperledger fabric for block chain.
-   Rich Hickey is a good way for learning decomplicting.
