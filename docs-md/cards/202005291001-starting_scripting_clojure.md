# Starting Scripting Clojure

How to enjoy scripting in Clojure? I am describing my small Clojure setup to let me experiment with the language and solve many of my tasks.

I am trying to explain how you could (and understand how to) start a REPL Driven Development in most folder location with low ceremony and with your (hopefully) favorite text editor


## What is the problem?

Setting the environment in Clojure is notoriously hard. When I started learning Clojure, we had to use leinigen, set the `project.clj` file with all the java/clojure options (I honestly still don&rsquo;t know them since I am using `deps.edn` now).

My annoyance was for many of my tasks, I just wanted to launch a REPL in a given folder, create a new `.clj` file, build a connection between the REPL and my text editor (Emacs obviously), and start to code and send forms to the REPL (REPL driven development).

When do this occasions arise? Usually, you just want to rename files in your tree, to work on some of your colleagues inputs and use Clojure for making the data transformation, or to create some command line scripts, or to solve online problems for training your Clojure skills.

Why does it matter? I used R and python previously. In both languages, I really appreciated the ability to just create a `.r` or `.py` file, open a REPL from Emacs and start to code interactively. It felt easy and lowered my cognitive load to experiment with the languages and learn them.

I think my appreciation of Clojure changed the day I managed to get the same workflow working in many context and it might help many.


## Goals

-   Ability to start scripting and a repl with your text editor in any folder with low ceremony.
-   Quick start of scripts in Clojure which can be converted into bigger project.


## Too long don&rsquo;t read

First, insure your text editor support `nrepl` (emacs, vim, IntelliJ, VS Code and Atom support it) and download the required package to support your Clojure development.

Then, two solutions

1.  Install clojure, and then for a

```bash
clojure
```

1.  For super fast startup and for shell scripting you can install babashka. Then start the repl with

```bash
bb --nrepl-server 1667
```


## Setting up your machines

-   nrepl
-   Brew install clojure, download babhaska.


### Adding dependencies

You can add deps.

If you use babashka, it has its own methods for adding dependencies (read here).


## Generality of the solution

So can we use the same process for *real* projects? Yes. Ironically, I found my solution while working on big projects. How do you start a bigger project? Create `deps.edn` in the root directory of your project, create your `src` folder, add the `:paths` (usually `["src"]`) and `:deps` and you can start organizing your code.

This workflow helped me tremendously when coding in ClojureScript. I use `shadow-cljs` and the typical workflow is to start it on the command line for compiling and watching change of your source code. I spent a bit of time understanding how I could connect Emacs to the REPL (`M-x cider-connect-cljs`) which was different than the typical `cider-jack-in` function.


## ClojureScript, other targets and considerations

I describe my workflow for writing quick script with Clojure JVM. Obviously, there are alternatives with other costs/benefits attributes.

-   lumo and plank for leveraging the node and the javascript environment.
-   joker, an Clojure implementation in Go.

That being said, I know many expert Clojurian have a single REPL process running for weeks, hence the start of a REPL might not matter after some level of expertise. I still like the ability to launch a REPL in any folder, without thinking too much.

In some situation, `nrepl` might be a too high requirement for your project (because the library does a lot under the hood). In this case, look at the socket REPL (insert link). I don&rsquo;t have a lot of experience with the socket REPL, except that emacs use the `inf-clojure` mode to interact with it.


## Steps summary

-   Find a text editor/IDE that supports the `nrepl` (it should not be that hard).
-   Write a simple command line that can launch a `nrepl` server in the root directory where you want to work. It can be as easy as calling `bb --nrepl-server` or `clojure -A:nrepl` after defining the `:nrepl` alias in `.clojure/deps.edn`. Note the port or set it to a fix value.
-   Create a `.clj` (anywhere)
-   Connect your text editor to the REPL and start sending forms from your file.
-   Once you feel comfortable with this workflow, see how you can adapt it to other situations (e.g. ClojureScript, react native, server repl, server vm).


## Conclusion

The goal of the post is to give you a straightforward plan for kick start repl driven development. You achieve this by having a compatible editor, launching a `nrepl` server with `clojure` or `bb` , connecting your editor to the REPL.

I hope this simple workflow will allow to experiment much more with Clojure and have fun with it.
