# Why Clojure?

-   Simplicity and concision (factor of 5 to 10), transparence.
-   Information driven (work with data).
-   Novelty of Lisp and functional programming.
-   Better at design
-   Macros, consumption, at change of paradigm
-   Immutable
-   Functions
-   Reach (jvm, js, python)
-   Concurrency and parallelism
-   Reference type and why
-   Testing
