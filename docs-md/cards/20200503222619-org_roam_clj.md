# org-roam-clj

Library for extending org-roam.

## Ideas

  - Check sha1/hash in db to know which files to updates.

  - Rewrite logic for tags to include indices and tags \[and not only
    roam alias?\].

  - Extend to markdown parsing.

  - YAML heading.

  - Own database \[implement same operation\].

  - GraalVM.

  - Git as a database.

  - Use Hugo for rendering.

  - Cross device syncing with privacy.

  - Use for leveraging:
    [org-parser](https://github.com/200ok-ch/org-parser)

  - Make own parser for displaying org files.

  - Learn about [instaparse](https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse/).

  - Automatic index cards pages with maybe tags with primary tags.

  - Pandoc for org to html conversion.

  - Use of datascript for database.

  - Use `#ROAM_TAGS:` for defining tags.

## Notes

  - Pandoc does not convert the links so it requires a filter.
