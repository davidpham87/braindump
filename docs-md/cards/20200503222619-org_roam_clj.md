# org-roam-clj

Library for extending org-roam.

## Ideas

-   Check sha1/hash in db to know which files to updates.

-   Rewrite logic for tags to include indices and tags \[and not only
    roam alias?\].

-   Extend to markdown parsing.

-   YAML heading.

-   Own database \[implement same operation\].

-   GraalVM.

-   Git as a database.

-   Use Hugo for rendering.

-   Cross device syncing with privacy.

-   Use for leveraging:
    [org-parser](https://github.com/200ok-ch/org-parser)

-   Make own parser for displaying org files.

-   Learn about [instaparse](https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse/).

-   Automatic index cards pages with maybe tags with primary tags.

-   Pandoc for org to html conversion.

-   Use of datascript for database.

-   Use `#ROAM_TAGS:` for defining tags.

## Notes

-   Pandoc does not convert the links so it requires a filter.
