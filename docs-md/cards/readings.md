## <span class="done DONE">DONE</span> How Google works

  - Culture is the one thing to get right.
  - Smart creatives are the core of the company. These are monsters, who
    can do everything and are social people.
  - Hiring is vital, colleagues must be learning animals and smarter
    than you are.
  - Consensus brings opposite point of view. Design someone as owner of
    meetings, transparency (about objectives, results and key results
    for all employees), manager sets deadlines.
  - Innovation: shoot for the moon.
  - Default to open for your technology.
  - Quality of a product is the only dimension on which on should focus.
  - Create new products because of technical insight.

## <span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> Becoming a better programmer, Pete Goodliffe

  - You.write(code)
      - Favor common convention in style, strive for consistency and
        clarity, good design is better that good presentation.
      - Write less code (elegance is paramount, DRY). Pay attention to
        logic operator to avoid if-else construct, use existing code to
        avoid bugs, delete dead code (never called function, never read
        variable, unused parameters and other types). Comments should
        explain the *why*. Try to use ternary operator as much as
        possible. Take responsibility of code removal and leave code a
        little better than it was.
      - Improve code by remove it. *Do not write code that you do not
        need now*. A system can improve by removing code. It is
        inevitable that dead code arises. Zombie code makes your life
        harder.
