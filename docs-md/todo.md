# TOOD List

This Todo file is a simple example of what I still have to learn or do.
These are the goals I would like to reach or interest me.

# Highly important

## Read

  - how to write notes efficiently.
  - org journal, org-roam-server.
  - git subrepositories (for multiple projects).
  - Check how org gather indices properties.
  - pods in babashka.

## Write

  - Simple made easy
  - test.check and generative testing

## Idea

  - Check sha1 in converting org files (because it is super slow
    otherwise) org-roam-clj
  - Download clojure.core and use materiala for testing.
    [Materiala](./cards/20200503165952-materiala.md)
  - Fork marginalia parser and correct its bug:
    [parser](https://github.com/gdeer81/marginalia/blob/master/src/marginalia/parser.clj)

## Goals

  - specs, core.async, datomic, testing.
  - Kubernetes, container technology.
  - Webworkers and websockets.
  - GPU computing
  - GraphQL
  - Spark
  - Kafka
  - Learn about databases (postgres, elastic search and datomic).
  - SICP, Read data science and algorithm manual.

view](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/)

## Multipass and Ansible

Use multipass and Ansible to simulate networks and kubernetes.

## Learn CSS

  - Write a summary (check create of Bulma)
  - [cljss](https://github.com/clj-commons/cljss),
    [woolybear](https://github.com/manutter51/woolybear)

## Leverage indices and org-parser

  - Check whether we can use indices to create better indexing.
  - Use pods and sqlite to leverage on the org-roam and extend it to
    markdown.
