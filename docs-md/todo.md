# TOOD List

This Todo file is a simple example of what I still have to learn or do.
These are the goals I would like to reach or interest me.

# Highly important

## Read

-   how to write notes efficiently.
-   org journal, org-roam-server.
-   git subrepositories (for multiple projects).
-   Check how org gather indices properties.
-   pods in babashka.

## Write

-   Simple made easy
-   test.check and generative testing

## Idea

-   Check sha1 in converting org files (because it is super slow
    otherwise) org-roam-clj
-   Download clojure.core and use materiala for testing.
    [Materiala](./id:973e1d96-4712-421f-8146-9c72325bdd34)
-   Fork marginalia parser and correct its bug:
    [parser](https://github.com/gdeer81/marginalia/blob/master/src/marginalia/parser.clj)

## Goals

-   specs, core.async, datomic, testing.
-   Kubernetes, container technology.
-   Webworkers and websockets.
-   GPU computing
-   GraphQL
-   Spark
-   Kafka
-   Learn about databases (postgres, elastic search and datomic).
-   SICP, Read data science and algorithm manual.

view](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/)

## Multipass and Ansible

Use multipass and Ansible to simulate networks and kubernetes.

## Learn CSS

-   Write a summary (check create of Bulma)
-   [cljss](https://github.com/clj-commons/cljss),
    [woolybear](https://github.com/manutter51/woolybear)

## Leverage indices and org-parser

-   Check whether we can use indices to create better indexing.
-   Use pods and sqlite to leverage on the org-roam and extend it to
    markdown.
