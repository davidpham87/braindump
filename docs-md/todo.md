# TOOD List

This Todo file is a simple example of what I still have to learn or do. These are the goals I would like to reach or interest me.


# Highly important


## Read

-   how to write notes efficiently.
-   org journal, org-roam-server.
-   git subrepositories (for multiple projects).
-   Check how org gather indices properties.
-   pods in babashka.


## Write

-   Simple made easy
-   test.check and generative testing


## Idea

-   Check sha1 in converting org files (because it is super slow otherwise) org-roam-clj
-   Download clojure.core and use materiala for testing. [Materiala](cards/20200503165952-materiala.md)
-   Fork marginalia parser and correct its bug: [parser](https://github.com/gdeer81/marginalia/blob/master/src/marginalia/parser.clj)


## Goals

-   specs, core async, datomic, testing.
-   Kubernetes, container technology.
-   Webworkers and websockets.
-   GPU computing
-   GraphQL
-   Spark
-   Kafka
-   Learn about databases (postgres, elastic search and datomic).
-   SICP, Read data science and algorithm manual.


## TODO Read Advanced Data Analysis from an elementary point of view

[Advanced data analysis from an elementary point of view](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/)


## Multipass and Ansible

Use multipass and Ansible to simulate networks and kubernetes.


## Learn CSS

-   Write a summary (check create of Bulma)
-   [cljss](https://github.com/clj-commons/cljss), [woolybear](https://github.com/manutter51/woolybear)


## Leverage indices and org-parser

-   Check whether we can use indices to create better indexing.
-   Use pods and sqlite to leverage on the org-roam and extend it to markdown.
