# How to Solve it

Basically, it is a receipe on how to solve logical problems (what is the
data, what are the constrains, what is the question)

# Design, Composition and Performance

It lays out the plan to build solutions when the problems are ambiguous
and will evolve in a dynamic world.

# Scientific Method and Skepticism

How do we know that what we know is true? We should ask ourselves how we
know things and where mistakes and bias might occur. This is this part
is important. Human are full of biases (perception and memory) and might
also employ fallacies to argue (such as the appeal to authority, to
nature or to perfect solution).
