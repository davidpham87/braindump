Maps should be the default choice, unless you decide to use protocols and need performance for dispatch. Protocols and multimethods are the two ways for dispatching. Protocols are faster in Clojure, but multimethods are more flexible. Processing Sequential Data. \u00b6 We can use map , filter , reduce to process sequence of values, but it might not be efficient. Transducers are created to avoid the concretion of the data structure. A transducer (usually denoted by xf or xform ) is a function that transform a reducing function into an another reducing function. That is xf: f -> g where f and g have signature whatever, input -> whatever . Concrete example of reducing function are conj with whatever being a list, + (with whatever being a number, and input a number). See here for more details. The trick is you can define map, filter and other operations as reducing function (reducing function are used in reduce operations usually). It is important to note that reducing function can actually grow the whatever (see conj ). We create them by omitting the coll argument in the typical sequence functions, e.g. (map f) yields a transducer. Use the sequence function to realize the transducer. The following calls are equal ( = ( map # ( * 2 % ) ( range 10 )) ( sequence ( map # ( * 2 % )) ( range 10 ))) If we need eagerness we could use into ( into [] ( map # ( * 2 % )) ( range 10 )) The benefit of transducer is intermediate values are not allocated and there is a decoupling of the transformations with the reducer (reducing function and reducible collection). They are also polymorphic. We can compose transducers and reduction with transduce ( def moons-transform ( comp ( filter planet? ) ( map :moons ))) ( defn total-moons [ entities ] ( transduce moons-transform + 0 entities )) See understanding transducers for more details. Duplicate removal with distinct and dedupe (only remove subsequent duplicate and safer for large input). Use mapcat instead of (-> map flatten) . Reference, State and Mutation \u00b6 Identity and state are two distinct notions. An identity is a sequence of immutable values, and the state is the actual value of an identity at a certain point of time. The challenge is to always display a single valid value to all the observer at the same time. There are two types of successions (mutation): atomic and transactions. An atomic transaction only cares about the change happening to the identity itself and not about the coordination of other identity. Transactional ensure that either all changes or none are performed. There are two states: program and runtime states. Program state is concerned with mutation in the problem domain, whereas runtime facilitate the software\u2019s execution (e.g. connections to databases or network, config files). Runtime state is often unavoidable whereas program state should be minimized and access through API with curated methods rather than directly. For managing change, we should build just enough to ensure the application\u2019s needs are met. Every side effect and mutable reference slows you down. We should be responsible over our functions (make them pure) and make choices about what need to be managed. State is a series of snapshots of values (data) which allows to act responsibly when considering the presence of observers in other processes. In Clojure, observers have consistent set of values as of a particular instant thanks to Clojure\u2019s mutable references. Use your cores \u00b6 One of the problem is to send task of the main thread to be completed asynchronously and retrieve the result ( future and promise ). Tasks and workers for long lived task-oriented concurrency. We can also use reducers and core.async (with channels and go blocks ). For agents, use send for computational tasks and won\u2019t block for I/O and send-off for updates that might block for an arbitrary time (thread pool will grow accordingly). The advantage is agent can maintain state compared to future . Use deref or @ for retrieving back the value of a future or promise . Promise are used to returns several values from a future block. Use realized? to check if a promise is available, otherwise it will block. The deref function with an additional argument can force timeout. Use Java queues and workers for task oriented programs. This is for coarse grained task parallelism. Queues , threads and executors are the tools from Java to perform a queue of incoming work or requests. For fine-grained parallelism The pmap function can be used for easy parallelism, but the overhead might be consequential. The clojure.core.reducer library is the solution for parallelism [fine-grained operations and memory efficient]. A reducer is reducible collection combined with a reducing function . fold is used to perform the reduction [only vectors and maps can be folded in parallel, but the serial version can be faster thanks to avoiding intermediary values]. A reducer splits the data into partition, reduce the elements and then combine them. The reduce and the combine functions can hence be different. Concurrency (design the program as a set of concurrent threads of execution) we can use core.async . Channels come in unbuffered, fixed buffered, dropping (discard new data) and sliding buffer (discard old data). Creating a channel is done with chan the function. nil can not be passed into channels (as it is the value for saying the channel is closed). The important operations are put and take . A full channel (once the buffer is complete) blocks a thread if no process other process is the other end of the channel to take the value sent by put . Backpressure is the efffect that fixed sized buffers creates by making the producers block when trying to add to a full queue. Traditionally channels are used in go block . In the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), process belongs to a thread pool and are parked when not blocked by a channel operation ( >! or <! ). Go blocks are great for building pipelines of data transformation. core.async/pipelines gives up the raw performance of fine-grained data parallelism but yield a more flexible architecture. The function moves the value from input to output channel with parallel transducer execution. Next step is to break a growing system into pieces using concurrency. Designing components \u00b6 Use of channels, better to receive and provide channels for interface. In core.async , a single go block is to call the body of the go block once asynchronously, while go-loop is intended for looping, unless we close the channel. go blocks return a channel, which can be used for pedestal. A good design is to split an API layer and implementation layer with a record. As for core.async , there are three additional concept for channels that are useful: pipeline, fan-in and fan-out. In a system, pipelines link an output channel to an input channel (acting like as a conveyor belt) and can possibly transform its input values with a transducer (async, sync, blocking). The pipe function should be used when no transformation. Fan-in channels gather the input of several channels and provide a single output channel. merge is a simple way to merge all the incoming channels into a single output channels, but it can\u2019t be modified after creation. The mix (for audio mix) function with its functions admix/unmix allows channel to participate in the mix. Users can toggle options for each input channel: :pause (no consumption nor inclusion in output channel), :mute (consumption but no inclusion), :solo ( if true, only solo-ed channels in output channel mix, :pause and :mute ignored if this is the case). Fan-out have three ways: mult , pub/sub , split . The mult abstraction is multiply traffic from the input channel into multiple output channels. Output channels (with different blocking policy) can participate in the connection with tap/untap (if a tap is closed, it is removed from the mult ). All the receiving channels must accept a value from the mult before the mult can move on to the next value. This is where alternative buffering strategy are useful. The pub/sub allows to distribute the traffic through a partition function and subscribers can inform to which partition value they want to lisen to. split divides the traffic two channels based on a truthiness of a predicate. split is actually a pub/sub with a partition function providing only truthy/falsy . Compose Your Application \u00b6 Taking things apart: usualy some portion of the code will work on the same data, or have the data has a common scope or lifetime, likelihehood of change from external requirement is similar are resource needed. If code is reusable when configured differently in more than one context, then it is a component. Component should communicate with channels, but in order to set up the system correctly, we need something to orchestrate it. Several library exist, the book recommends Component , but it has been super-seeded by integrant . An example can be found here reitit/integrant . Environment variable also should exist with different settings. The solution in the book are a bit old. Environ still seems to be good on clojure (jvm). Testing \u00b6 There are three ways to create tests in clojure: repl, example based, generative testing (properties check). With REPL driven development, the example used for development are stored in a file (these are candidates for examples). For example based, there is the expectations library and the following snippets ( deftest test-range-are ( testing \"Testing range(endIndex)\" ( are [ expected endIndex ( = ( range endIndex ) expected ) ' ( 0 1 2 3 4 ) 5 ' () 0 ]))) Generative testing using ( ns generative-testing.core ( :require [ clojure.test.check :as tc ] [ clojure.test.check.generators :as gen ] [ clojure.test.check.properties :as prop ])) I think nowadays we would use spec for it. We are looking for invariants \u2013 properties that are always true. [\u2026] mathematical laws, relationships between inputs and outputs, round-trip or complementing functions, and comparing action effects. Properties like identity, associativity, commutativity and idempotency are an excellent place to start. Invariants are important because they reduce the number of case your code must consider. Thinking in Clojure \u00b6 Make Reasoned Choices: always compare trade-off of solutions (benefits and costs). Think first, then do . Careful treatment of decisions and weighed trade-off to fully understand the consequences. Be Reasonable: code with clearly expressed intent, limited side effects, neatly separated concerns, and unambiguous naming. Simple. Keep It Simple: Keep distinct concern as distinct as possible and avoid entangling concepts with other concepts. The code can be reasoned about, test and implemented without any incidental complexity. Entities are simplest when distinct and composable. Domain functions avoid complexity by avoiding side effects and concerning themselves only with entities in their domain. Build Just Enough: Keep complexity at bay and avoid overengineering. Compose: compose component, and evaluate your code composability by using it from another component. Results will be a set of tidy interfaces to distinct independent subsystems with clear communication channels. With a stable interface, a component can grow easily and adapt quickly. Be Precise: avoid ambiguity and communicate clearly with others and your future self. Entities typify one concept. Functions effect a single transformation. Queries ask simple questions and return unambiguous results. Use What Works: look for working libraries, solution in other languages or papers.

An identity is a sequence of immutable values, and the state is the actual value of an identity at a certain point of time. The challenge is to always display a single valid value to all the observer at the same time. There are two types of successions (mutation): atomic and transactions. An atomic transaction only cares about the change happening to the identity itself and not about the coordination of other identity. Transactional ensure that either all changes or none are performed. There are two states: program and runtime states. Program state is concerned with mutation in the problem domain, whereas runtime facilitate the software\u2019s execution (e.g. connections to databases or network, config files). Runtime state is often unavoidable whereas program state should be minimized and access through API with curated methods rather than directly. For managing change, we should build just enough to ensure the application\u2019s needs are met. Every side effect and mutable reference slows you down. We should be responsible over our functions (make them pure) and make choices about what need to be managed. State is a series of snapshots of values (data) which allows to act responsibly when considering the presence of observers in other processes. In Clojure, observers have consistent set of values as of a particular instant thanks to Clojure\u2019s mutable references.","title":"Reference, State and Mutation"},{"location":"cards/20200430155637-applied_clojure/#use-your-cores","text":"One of the problem is to send task of the main thread to be completed asynchronously and retrieve the result ( future and promise ). Tasks and workers for long lived task-oriented concurrency. We can also use reducers and core.async (with channels and go blocks ). For agents, use send for computational tasks and won\u2019t block for I/O and send-off for updates that might block for an arbitrary time (thread pool will grow accordingly). The advantage is agent can maintain state compared to future . Use deref or @ for retrieving back the value of a future or promise . Promise are used to returns several values from a future block. Use realized? to check if a promise is available, otherwise it will block. The deref function with an additional argument can force timeout. Use Java queues and workers for task oriented programs. This is for coarse grained task parallelism. Queues , threads and executors are the tools from Java to perform a queue of incoming work or requests. For fine-grained parallelism The pmap function can be used for easy parallelism, but the overhead might be consequential. The clojure.core.reducer library is the solution for parallelism [fine-grained operations and memory efficient]. A reducer is reducible collection combined with a reducing function . fold is used to perform the reduction [only vectors and maps can be folded in parallel, but the serial version can be faster thanks to avoiding intermediary values]. A reducer splits the data into partition, reduce the elements and then combine them. The reduce and the combine functions can hence be different. Concurrency (design the program as a set of concurrent threads of execution) we can use core.async . Channels come in unbuffered, fixed buffered, dropping (discard new data) and sliding buffer (discard old data). Creating a channel is done with chan the function. nil can not be passed into channels (as it is the value for saying the channel is closed). The important operations are put and take . A full channel (once the buffer is complete) blocks a thread if no process other process is the other end of the channel to take the value sent by put . Backpressure is the efffect that fixed sized buffers creates by making the producers block when trying to add to a full queue. Traditionally channels are used in go block . In the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), process belongs to a thread pool and are parked when not blocked by a channel operation ( >! or <! ). Go blocks are great for building pipelines of data transformation. core.async/pipelines gives up the raw performance of fine-grained data parallelism but yield a more flexible architecture. The function moves the value from input to output channel with parallel transducer execution. Next step is to break a growing system into pieces using concurrency.","title":"Use your cores"},{"location":"cards/20200430155637-applied_clojure/#designing-components","text":"Use of channels, better to receive and provide channels for interface. In core.async , a single go block is to call the body of the go block once asynchronously, while go-loop is intended for looping, unless we close the channel. go blocks return a channel, which can be used for pedestal. A good design is to split an API layer and implementation layer with a record. As for core.async , there are three additional concept for channels that are useful: pipeline, fan-in and fan-out. In a system, pipelines link an output channel to an input channel (acting like as a conveyor belt) and can possibly transform its input values with a transducer (async, sync, blocking). The pipe function should be used when no transformation. Fan-in channels gather the input of several channels and provide a single output channel. merge is a simple way to merge all the incoming channels into a single output channels, but it can\u2019t be modified after creation. The mix (for audio mix) function with its functions admix/unmix allows channel to participate in the mix. Users can toggle options for each input channel: :pause (no consumption nor inclusion in output channel), :mute (consumption but no inclusion), :solo ( if true, only solo-ed channels in output channel mix, :pause and :mute ignored if this is the case). Fan-out have three ways: mult , pub/sub , split . The mult abstraction is multiply traffic from the input channel into multiple output channels. Output channels (with different blocking policy) can participate in the connection with tap/untap (if a tap is closed, it is removed from the mult ). All the receiving channels must accept a value from the mult before the mult can move on to the next value. This is where alternative buffering strategy are useful. The pub/sub allows to distribute the traffic through a partition function and subscribers can inform to which partition value they want to lisen to. split divides the traffic two channels based on a truthiness of a predicate. split is actually a pub/sub with a partition function providing only truthy/falsy .","title":"Designing components"},{"location":"cards/20200430155637-applied_clojure/#compose-your-application","text":"Taking things apart: usualy some portion of the code will work on the same data, or have the data has a common scope or lifetime, likelihehood of change from external requirement is similar are resource needed.

There are numerous concepts we should take apart (needs to problem, information to mechanism, knowns to unknowns, domain to technological solution, benefits and tradeoffs of solutions.) Design is an effective way to reduce the cost of bugs and to test our software as test now embeds the value of our design. Composition is about constraints and communication. A composition is a design, or a plan for the performer. Bigger scales require more precision and lower scale allows more freedom to the performer. Performance is about preparation, study and experience. It is the ability to bring our knowledge and our experience to solve the problem on a given context. Most coders stop learning after college which is a contrast to any artistic career who are lifelong learners. Both activities requires a sensibility about harmony (in a given context, will two things work well together?). Programming languages are like instruments. As such, we should chose those who are backing some fundamental idea (e.g. immutability, functional programming) and chose those who are aimed to those who have studied the language. In software engineering, everything is code all the way down. Hence we have a paralysis of choice and distraction (we can improve any part of the problem). Making choices, and hence putting constraints move us forward. Thus, the value of the design is based on the decision made. In conclusion, good design is about taking things about such that we can put them back together, we should compose by requiring as much constraint as possible, perform by preparing and studying and finally choose and learn simple tools aimed to experts. Notes \u00b6 Disclamer (joke): analogies are like equivalence, except when they are not. Design by definition is about to prepare the plans for (a work to be executed), especially to plan the form and the structure of. Execution is interesting as someone or a machine will perform the work. The root is to mark out, to make a plan and write it down. The value proposition of design: the bugs are the cheapest at design phases, when they are good. What is a good design? Good design is about taking things apart. We want to separating and break down things into several pieces in such a way that they can be put together again, i.e. recomposed. Each component should be about one or a few things. We solve a problem by composing the parts and it is iterative. Design is about taking things apart. Requirements: move from the want/need to the problems. Take the features and requirements and break them down into a problems perspective. We can explicit the knowns to the unknowns (what do we know how to do, from what we don\u2019t know how to do?). Requirement from the domain side (what does the information encodes and what purpose its transformation will it serve for the customer) to the solution side (on which technology should the code run). We can split the cause and the symptom for the problem (how do you solve a black screen problem?), and explicit the unstated requirement (e.g. should not destroy the machine or crash), these are the state we should to avoid. We should transform the set all of need/features to the intrinsic problems. Time, order and flow: In which ordering are the operation to happen, can they be commutative? Queues. Idempotency (redundant activity), transactions (operations have to happen together at the same time). Place, participants: Who (developer) is participating into the process? Which processes (which systems)? Planing about independent development. Information and mechanism: Which components belongs to the information or business problem, and which belongs to the technical solution. Information is usually a logical abstract idea (the sets of users) against a language construct to represent them (=#{:a :b :c}). It is information against the mechanics of a program. Solutions: We have to compare multiple solutions and state their benefits and trade offs, costs and problem fit (if the solution is not too larger to the problem). Why Design? We can understand the system (because design is smaller). Coordination (for writing the code). Extension and reuse (the broken pieces of system become connecting points, and new pieces can be connected to the pieces and thus extend them). As the pieces are independent, they can be reuse in other contexts as well. Testing is facilitated as the design constraints are put into test, in opposition as tests driving the design (quickcheck is interesting we need to think at properties and the computer write the test). Efficiency : the easiest and cheapest way to remove bugs is at design phases, even after shipping, the solution for bugs in the field is to break things even more. Composition is about addressing self imposed problems and constraints. Learning requires inefficiency. Constraint is a driver of creativity. So we should ask as much constraint as possible when solving a problem. We are forced to take a choice and move on. Composition is designed for performers and is an organizational challenge. In composition, there is a vast variety of specificity and scale (fully orchestrated, arranged, larger scales in opposition to melody and changes, increased latitude for performance and more responsibility). Most composition are about one or a few things. (melodic, harmonic, rhythmic, timbral ideas). Theme: variations, resolutions, larger works, provides more structural components. Improvisation (not foreseen or provided). The melody and the changes and provides constraints. The performer provides variations. Improvisation (well executed) requires a tremendous amount of preparation, practice and study . It is about dynamic composition of planned material. The skill is about preparation of plans, material or sensibilities and apply them in the correct situation. Deep knowledge and vocabulary is necessary. Harmony (accord, congruity, how does things line up in simultaneous combinations). How do things work together when applied at the same time? It might also be the art or science concerned with the structure and combination. Harmonic sensibility is a key design skill . A good designer knows, in a given context, if they make new choices, the pieces will be harmonious (or work together), and the knowledge is acquired through study and experience. In the context of music, great composer and performers were masters of harmony, and they were students of harmoniousness. They went beyond the rules, they developed their own comprehension. They made new systems that preserver/explore harmonic essences. Programming languages are more like instruments. Most instrument are about one excitation (pluck, vibrate, strike), combined with control and interface to shape the excitation, with the projection (the problem is how people will hear the sound). They all also have the resonance problem (the body of the instrument will respond to the excitation). Instruments are limited (piano can\u2019t play in-between notes, saxophone can only play one note at a time). They are minimal yet sufficient (no missing notes usually). The shortcomings might be overcome by the player. Instruments are made for people who can play them. But beginners are not players yet. So we should stop designing languages for maximizing the first 5 minutes of experience of a language and we should target long term productivity. (The talk make criticism about cello which should auto-tunes, having green/red lights for good bad notes, or should note make any sound until the whole piece is played perfectly). The first critic is about coercion/javascript and the second one is about IDE, and the third is about static type compile checking (which would not run your program until it is self consistent with the types rules). Learning requires inefficiency. Players endures pains to overcome and learn instruments. Humans are incredible, good learners and good teachers. Minimizing beginners effort as primary goal will never allow them to reach virtuous abilities with the tools. So teaching and learning are not effort-free. We are all novices (beginner for only a really brief moment). We are permanently students. It takes efforts. Overcoming effort and accomplishing things provides a sense of engagement (effort matters). Instruments (and tools) are usually for one user. We should practice and plan much more than performing. Coders spend more time performing than studying (unlike other creative people). In order to be creative you hate to know how to prepare to be creative \u2013 Twyla Tharp, The Creative Habit. There is too much focus and emphasis on how fast a beginner can accomplish some things against what is required to be effective in the real world. Electronic instruments are at the intersection of art and computer software. In their construction, there are two types of interfaces: machine and human. The instrument makers were smart as they built a human interface on top the machine interface allowing to compose. In contrast in IT, we have two examples where human interface were designed first and brings a lot of problems: SQL and UNIX. When we need to programmatically interface with these, we need to smash strings together or parse the output from a another process. Design can also be layered and people are concerned with different matters. But for IT: code all the way down, we have the same mechanism at every layer (it does mean we can do filter design). It leads to distraction and unnecessary expansion. It yields the paralysis of choice (we don\u2019t know what to do). We need the impetus of constraint. Constraint drives creativity as it helps to move forward (when we have a few choices, we need to make a choice and move on). We need to quit fidgeting (agglomerating, fiddling, tweakling). Maybe a lot of good ideas does not lead to a good construct. Design is imagining (potential solutions) and embrace constraints, rush to them, create additional if not enough restrictive. It is optimistic , be positive and imagine a lot. Design is about making decisions. The value conveyed is in decisions made . Admit very little, and ability to say no. Leaving all options open is avoiding design. Performing is preparing (planning). We should practice and study. Develop sensibilities you can apply on the fly (pattern, techniques, knowledge what works and what not). Design is about taking things apart in order to be able to pull them back together. Design like Bartok ( communicate very well at multiple levels). Code like Coltrane ( prepare, study and experience , by doing multiple different things and not the same thing over and over), such that it feels more like improvisation. Find and choose tools that are like instruments (stable, simple , directed at one thing, and oriented around people who know how to use them). They should express and backing some fundamental idea (or excitation for instruments). Try to pursue harmony in the design, about the nature of harmoniousness, about what make things work together in a given context.

The goal is to gather most function in a single place and also acts as a reminder. High leverage on specifying entities in Clojure code. Adds validation Conformance Documentation Generative testing Specs are predicates and can be composed with the assigned keys. You want to add this dependency at test time for generative testing ;; deps.edn { :aliases { :dev { :extra-deps { org.clojure/test.check { :mvn/version \"1.0.0\" }}}}} Definitions \u00b6 s/def defines specs (with fully qualified keys). s/valid and s/conform are the most important function for checking on runtime the specifications of input/output. ( require ' [ clojure.spec.alpha :as s ]) ( s/def :image/size ( s/cat :height pos-int? :width pos-int? :depth pos-int? )) ( s/conform :image/size [ 10 23 4 ]) ;; useful for turning tuples into maps ;; => {:height 10, :width 23, :depth 4} ( s/valid? :image/size [ 10 23 4 ]) ;; => true ( s/valid? :image/size [ 10 23 \"s\" ]) ;; => false ( s/valid? :image/size [ 10 23 -1 ]) ;; => false Composition is achieved with s/and and s/or ( s/def ::big-even ( s/and pos-int? even? # ( > % 1000 ))) ( s/def ::identifier ( s/or :name string? :id pos-int? )) ( s/conform ::identifier \"abc\" ) ( s/conform ::identifier 100 ) explain allows to have data on why a spec is failing. Entities map \u00b6 Entities map are defined with s/keys and has the req , req-un , opt , opt-un keywords argument ( un stands for unqualified keys). Sequential keyword arguments can be defined with the s/keys* function which will check vector of keywords-values pair. You can use s/and and s/or with the keys for a finer definition of membership of keys (for example when a field in a map, then other keys are required and having different element conforming). For example, either an email or a id string is required being conform. Collection \u00b6 Collection has s/cat , s/coll-of , s/every , s/map-of , s/every-kv , s/tuple . The last one is the most permissive as it similar product type. every and every-kv are suitable for large collection as they will not conform their value (trade off against coll-of and map-of is error message are less detailed). ( s/def ::point-0 ( s/tuple double? double? )) ( s/def ::x double? ) ( s/def ::y double? ) ( s/def ::point-1 ( s/tuple ::x ::y )) ( s/def ::point-2 ( s/cat :x double? :y double? )) ( s/def ::point-3 ( s/coll-of? double? )) ;; additional arguments: :kind (type such as vector?) ;; :count (exact) :min-count (minimal) :max-count (maximal) :distinct (unique ;; values) :into ([] {} () #{}) Multi specs \u00b6 You can use multimethods to define multi-specs. Useful for conforming maps depending on certain keys. ( defmulti event-type :event/type ) ( defmethod event-type :event/search [ _ ] ( s/keys :req [ :event/type :event/timestamp :search/url ])) ( defmethod event-type :event/error [ _ ] ( s/keys :req [ :event/type :event/timestamp :error/message :error/code ])) ( s/def :event/type keyword? ) ;; this will be used by multi-spec ;; the last argument is used for generative testing ( s/def :event/event ( s/multi-spec event-type :event/type )) ( s/valid? :event/event { :event/type :event/search :event/timestamp 1463970123000 :search/url \"https://clojure.org\" }) ;; => true ( s/explain :event/event { :event/type :event/search :search/url 200 }) ;; fails because missing timestamp ;; 200 - failed: string? in: [:search/url] ;; at: [:event/search :search/url] spec: :search/url ;; {:event/type :event/search, :search/url 200} - failed: (contains? % :event/timestamp) ;; at: [:event/search] spec: :event/event Sequence specs \u00b6 Sequences can be expressed with the regular expression operators s/cat , s/alt , s/* , s/+ , s/? . s/alt is difference from or as it will select one precisely and is usually use with s/cat . You can s/describe to take the description of a spec. s/& allows to combine and regex operators and additional predicates. s/spec should be used for nesting regex specs. ( s/def ::nested ( s/cat :names-kw # { :names } :names ( s/spec ( s/* string? )) :nums-kw # { :nums } :nums ( s/spec ( s/* number? )))) ( s/conform ::nested [ :names [ \"a\" \"b\" ] :nums [ 1 2 3 ]]) ;; => {:names-kw :names, :names [\"a\" \"b\"], :nums-kw :nums, :nums [1 2 3]} ( s/def ::unnested ( s/cat :names-kw # { :names } :names ( s/* string? ) :nums-kw # { :nums } :nums ( s/* number? ))) ( s/conform ::unnested [ :names \"a\" \"b\" :nums 1 2 3 ]) ;; => {:names-kw :names, :names [\"a\" \"b\"], :nums-kw :nums, :nums [1 2 3]} Validation \u00b6 Assertion can be done with s/assert , on success the value is returned on failure assertion error is thrown. Default is assertion checking is off, and can be change with s/check-asserts . Using s/conform , the result is either conformed, or ::s/invalid which is a special key and can be used for throwing errors. ;; ex-info stands for exception info ( when ( = ( s/conform ::config input ) ::s/invalid ) ( throw ( ex-info \"Invalid input\" ( s/explain-data ::config input )))) Functions specs \u00b6 s/fdef defines spec of a function while s/fspec allows to defines a generic function signature. The keys are :args , :ret and :fn all accepts predicates/specs as argument. The :fn keyword arguments is special as it is meant for defining properties of the function for generative testing (similar to prop/for-all in test.check ). The properties can be enforced on the argument (preconditions) on the result (post conditions) or on a relationship between the arguments and the return value or some invariant properties on the function call itself. See Generative Testing . Generation \u00b6 The main namespace is ( require ' [ clojure.spec.gen.alpha :as gen ]) and the function are gen/generate , gen/sample allows to generate value from the specs. If you want to conformed data as well you can use the s/exercise for sample value and conformed and s/exercise-fn to see to see sample arguments and results.

Summary \u00b6 The talks goes around what the definition of simple and easy, and how as programmers we like complex constructs, because they are familiar and as we are in the conceptual and creative industry, our egos forbid us to accept that some tasks are too complex for us to handle (but especially for familiarity). Simple is an objective measure of how things are entangled, intertwined, not compound, whereas easy has a notion of familiarity and nearness (physical, knowledge and mental capability). Complex is the opposite of simple (when things are braided, tied, or folded together) and hard is the opposite of easy. When accessing the output of work, we should consider the properties of the artifacts (that thing that was made) more than those of the constructs. Is it effective? Understandable? Modifiable? Can be debugged? In contrast, none of our customer will care how easy it was to create the artifact if it does not fulfill the previous objectives. Simplicity matters as our cognitive ability to handle complexity is limited, hence complexity undermines the ability to think in isolation. Complexity affects our ability to change our artifacts as we need to able reason about a program for changing without fear (using informal reasoning, not category theory). Similarly, the ability to reason about a program allows us to solve bugs and no types nor tests increase the ability to reason about a program. Even though ease provides early speed, ignoring complexity will slow down the development or the long haul (it does not matter for trivial projects). Simplicity will be slower at the beginning because it requires thinking and design. Notes \u00b6 I usually summarize point I find interesting and quote the moment I find legendary. Some of the following sentence are just copy pasting from the slides. Simple, Complexes in contrast to Easy and Hard. \u00b6 Simple means disentangled, without braid, not compound, not twisted. Usually, it goes around one role, topic, concept, dimension, subject. But we should not focus on the one thing, instance or operations. It is about the lack of interleaving and it is objective. How to make complex things simple. Simple you have to disentangle them (or simplify them by the definition of unfolding). Ease is about adjacency or nearness and easy is relative. It is near at hand (hard drive, tool set, ID, understanding and skill set, familiar). I think that, collectively, we are infatuated with these two notions of easy. We are just so self-involved in these two aspects; it\u2019s hurting us tremendously. Right? All we care about is, you know, can I get this instantly and start running it in five seconds? It could be this giant hairball that you got, but all you care is, you know, can you get it. In addition, we\u2019re fixated on, oh, I can\u2019t; I can\u2019t read that. Now I can\u2019t read German. Does that mean German is unreadable? No. I don\u2019t know German. So, you know, this sort of approach is definitely not helpful. In particular, if you want everything to be familiar, you will never learn anything new because it can\u2019t be significantly different from what you already know and not drift away from the familiarity. Finally it is near our capabilities. This point is taboo, because we are in conceptual work and due to a combination of hubris and insecurity, we never talk about. Ease is subjective and relative as well (language and skills acquired by training are example). There\u2019s a third aspect of being easy that I don\u2019t think we think enough about that\u2019s going to become critical to this discussion, which now is being near to our capabilities. And we don\u2019t like to talk about this because it makes us uncomfortable because what kind of capabilities are we talking about? If we\u2019re talking about easy in the case of violin playing or piano playing or mountain climbing or something like that, well, you know, I don\u2019t personally feel bad if I don\u2019t play the violin well because I don\u2019t play the violin at all. But the work that we\u2019re in is conceptual work, so when we start talking about something being outside of our capability, well, you know, it really starts trampling on our egos in a big way. And so, you know, due to a combination of hubris and insecurity, we never really talk about whether or not something is outside of our capabilities. It ends up that it\u2019s not so embarrassing after all because we don\u2019t have tremendously divergent abilities in that area. The relevant point here is that whenever is hard, because it is conceptually complex, our egos prevent us to accept that the task is too complex and that we probably can\u2019t handle it. The reason why we can not have objective discussion about qualities that matters in our software is because we conflate the two notions of easy and simple (because we say something that is simple if it is near our abilities or familiarity). Construct vs Artifact \u00b6 Software are created using constructs (programming language, libraries) which, in and of themselves, have characteristic and we build artifact out of them.. But we\u2019re in a business of artifacts . Right? We don\u2019t ship source code, and the user doesn\u2019t look at our source code and say, \u201cAh, that\u2019s so pleasant.\u201d Right? No? They run our software, and they run it for a long period of time. And, over time, we keep glomming more stuff on our software. All of that stuff, the running of it, the performance of it, the ability to change it all is an attribute of the artifact, not the original construct. However, developers focus on their experience and the characteristic of the constructs (language, less typing) leading to the notion of programmer convenience at the detriment of the programmer: employers love the fact they can replace any programmer as long as our artifacts seems familiar to anyone (does not mean someone else can understand it though). That focus on experience of the use of the construct comes at the expanse the long term result. Does the software do what it is supposed to do? High quality? Can we rely on it? Fix problems when they arise? Change it, given a new requirement? These question are not properties of the constructs but with the attribute of the artifacts. Limits \u00b6 We can only hope to make reliable those thing we can understand. We can only consider a few things at a time. Intertwined things must be considered together. We lose the ability to think of them in isolation. And the burden becomes combinatorial with the number of things under consideration. Complexity undermines understanding. Change and Debugging \u00b6 So how do we change our software? Apparently, I heard in a talk today, that Agile and Extreme Programming have shown that refactoring and tests allow us to make change with zero impact. I never knew that. I still do not know that. That\u2019s not actually a knowable thing. That\u2019s phooey. Change to software require analysis and decisions. What will be impacted of a potential change? Where do changes need to be made? You know, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re using XP or Agile or anything else. You\u2019re not going to get around the fact that if you can\u2019t reason about your program, you can\u2019t make these decisions The ability to reason about your program is critical to changing it without fear. Not talking about proof, just informal reasoning. One problem is to create new functionalities and the other face of the problem is to fix the parts we did not solve correctly (debugging). And I like to ask this question: What\u2019s true of every bug found in the field? \u2026 It passed the type checker \u2026 [and] all the tests. \u2026 I think we\u2019re in this world I\u2019d like to call guardrail programming. \u2026 We\u2019re like: I can make change because I have tests. Who does that? Who drives their car around banging against the guardrail saying, \u201cWhoa! I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve got these guardrails because I\u2019d never make it to the show on time.\u201d Right? And - and do the guardrails help you get to where you want to go? Like, do guardrails guide you places? No. There are guardrails everywhere. They don\u2019t point your car in any particular direction. We are going to need to be able to reason about our program and use ordinary logic to determine the location of the problem in a program. Development Speed \u00b6 What kind of runner can run as fast as they possibly can from the very start of a race? Right, only somebody who runs really short races, okay? But of course, we are programmers, and we are smarter than runners, apparently, because we know how to fix that problem, right? We just fire the starting pistol every hundred yards and call it a new sprint. I don\u2019t know why they haven\u2019t figured that out, but \u2013 right. It\u2019s my contention, based on experience, that if you ignore complexity, you will slow down. You will invariably slow down over the long haul. Easy Yet Complex \u00b6 And they\u2019re easy to use. In fact, by all measures, conventional measures, you would look at them and say this is easy. Right? But we don\u2019t care about that. Right? Again, the user is not looking at our software, and they don\u2019t actually care very much about how good a time we had when we were writing it. Right? What they care about is what the program does, and if it works well, it will be related to whether or not the output of those constructs were simple. In other words, what complexity did they yield? When there is complexity there, we\u2019re going to call that incidental complexity. Right? It wasn\u2019t part of what the user asked us to do. We chose a tool. It had some inherent complexity in it. It\u2019s incidental to the problem. I didn\u2019t put the definition in here, but incidental is Latin for your fault. How do we usually complect our work? \u00b6 I don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t wanna know.

Simple is an objective measure of how things are entangled, intertwined, not compound, whereas easy has a notion of familiarity and nearness (physical, knowledge and mental capability). Complex is the opposite of simple (when things are braided, tied, or folded together) and hard is the opposite of easy. When accessing the output of work, we should consider the properties of the artifacts (that thing that was made) more than those of the constructs. Is it effective? Understandable? Modifiable? Can be debugged? In contrast, none of our customer will care how easy it was to create the artifact if it does not fulfill the previous objectives. Simplicity matters as our cognitive ability to handle complexity is limited, hence complexity undermines the ability to think in isolation. Complexity affects our ability to change our artifacts as we need to able reason about a program for changing without fear (using informal reasoning, not category theory). Similarly, the ability to reason about a program allows us to solve bugs and no types nor tests increase the ability to reason about a program. Even though ease provides early speed, ignoring complexity will slow down the development or the long haul (it does not matter for trivial projects). Simplicity will be slower at the beginning because it requires thinking and design.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"cards/20200502122138-simple_made_easy/#notes","text":"I usually summarize point I find interesting and quote the moment I find legendary.

For me, nginx is the tools that solves the question: How can I serve multiple web apps from a single server with a common root? How can I serve multiple domain from the same server? Usually, the nginx root folder is stored under /etc/nginx . Note that adaptation (usually path) might be required between linux distributions. First of all, when you distribute multiple web app, it is much easier if you can have multiple domain names: web apps will have their routes and avoid paths conflict. In this case you will create server block for each domain. Tips: pay attention to the slashes ( / ) it the path, as nginx mainly concatenate strings, so you might accidentally have double slashes in your path which usually leads to unintended consequence. Server blocks \u00b6 Server blocks usually lives in the conf.d or sites-availables server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; root /var/www/your_domain/html; index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html; server_name your_domain www.your_domain; location / { try_files $uri $uri/ =404; } } where your_domain is replaced by the domain you own. The root directive provides the root of your web app, the folder needs to be reachable by the process which started nginx. If the server block is defined in sites-availables , you need to create a symlink into the sites-enabled folder. Root directive \u00b6 The root directive provides the root path of your request. In the previous server block, the response from nginx to the request on the path www.your_domain/css/file.css will be the filer located under /var/www/your_domain/html/css/file.css , because /var/www/your_domain/html was defined as the root and /css/file.css is the path requested. If the files does not exists, the 404 (not found) answer is returned. Nginx has concatenated the root with the path. You can change the root for each location directive, which can handy for distribution under several folders (see later). Static file distribution through alias \u00b6 Usually, you desire to use some path of your domain to target different folder because they serve the files for your webapp. Most webapp are defined as if they were placed on the root folder, so if the web app is distributed under /my_webapp the associated assets files (javascript, css, images) will usually be unfound. To solve this problem, we use the alias directive. In a server block (the default or any other), the following directive will alias the www.your_domain/my_webapp to /var/www/my_webapp/html . location /my_webapp { alias /var/www/my_webapp/html; } The consequences are that nginx will answer to request www.your_domain/my_webapp/css/file.css with the file /var/www/my_webapp/html/css/files.css , concatenating the alias and the path. If root instead of alias was used, nginx would have returned /var/www/my_webapp/html/my_webapp/css/file.css , because nginx always append the full path to the route, whereas alias replace the the match path with the value provided to alias. In my personal experience, you will use and abuse alias more often than root. Proxy pass \u00b6 When creating web apps, you will often create a backend server. This server will usually be connected to some port under root (e.g. 8000, 8050, 8081). Under development, you will often use localhost:8050 as domain. In production, you will launch the same program which will still listen to the same port. However, you want your user to call a path on your_domain . The proxy_pass directive is the solution to this problem. location /backend_path { proxy_pass locahost:8050; } Hence the for each request called to my_domain//backend_path/data , the backend will match it to /data . Obviously you can use nginx to also perform some indirection location /backend_path/x { proxy_pass locahost:8050/y; } In this case, under the request my_domain//backend_path/x/data , the backend will return the handler registered under the route /y/data . Regex path \u00b6 Regex can be used to match multiple paths in nginx. You start a regex path by adding a tilde ~ sign after location and then using standard regex notation to reuse the match parts. location ~ /images/(.+)$ { try_files /other_images_folders/$1 =404; } Multiple source folder \u00b6 It might happens that your apps call the same path, but the content is located in different folder. In this case, we can combine root and regex to sovle the issue. location ~ /images/(.+)$ { root /var/www; try_files /my_webapp/images/$1 /your_domain/images/$1 =404; } Here nginx will try to server /images/file.jpeg from /my_webapp/images/file.jpeg before /your_domain/images/file.jpeg . HTTPS \u00b6 In order to promote the connection to https, you will need to change the server blocks and define the path of your certificates. server { listen 443 ssl; server_name www.example.com; ssl_certificate path/to/www.example.com.crt; ssl_certificate_key path/to/www.example.com.key; ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5; } Usually, you will want letsencrypt (if you own the domain name) to save this for you. Websocket \u00b6 In order to allow websocket, you must upgrade the connection. For this you can adapt the following snippet under the desired location: location /shadow-cljs/ { # upgrade to websocket proxy_pass http://localhost:9630/; proxy_http_version 1.1; proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Connection \"Upgrade\"; proxy_set_header Host $host; } Links \u00b6 https://nginx.org/en/ Digital ocean guide An Introduction to DNS Terminology, Components, and Concepts See also (generated) \u00b6 Devops shadow-cljs","title":"nginx"},{"location":"cards/20200505112918-nginx/#nginx","text":"This is a quick reminder about a few tricks in nginx.

Geneartive Testing, Group Theory and Category Theory \u00b6 The model based properties (as in how to specify it) are the most powerful when you can find an isomorphism between your function or system under test for a certain algebras (or structure, or restricted invariant). This is powerful because you can then apply your operation on your model space which is probably much simpler and in all time transform the result back into function space. As finding algebraic structure (or group operation) might be too restrictive, we can relax the hypothesis to category theory (as long as we still have a bijective/ismorphic map). Isomorphism spaces are useful as they equivalent and their representation might used from one space to the other for practical purposes. For practical concerns, once you find an isomorphism to the function or entity under test, you can usually find many equivalent operations from your system onto your model and can randomly apply these property in any order to insure that your implementation is correct. Property Based Testing with Proper \u00b6 Side effects can be grouped together at one end of the system, and we can keep the rest of the code as pure as possible.

I am describing my small Clojure setup to let me experiment with the language and solve many of my tasks. I am trying to explain how you could (and understand how to) start a REPL Driven Development in most folder location with low ceremony and with your (hopefully) favorite text editor What is the problem? \u00b6 Setting the environment in Clojure is notoriously hard. When I started learning Clojure, we had to use leinigen, set the project.clj file with all the java/clojure options (I honestly still don\u2019t know them since I am using deps.edn now). My annoyance was for many of my tasks, I just wanted to launch a REPL in a given folder, create a new .clj file, build a connection between the REPL and my text editor (Emacs obviously), and start to code and send forms to the REPL (REPL driven development). When do this occasions arise? Usually, you just want to rename files in your tree, to work on some of your colleagues inputs and use Clojure for making the data transformation, or to create some command line scripts, or to solve online problems for training your Clojure skills. Why does it matter? I used R and python previously. In both languages, I really appreciated the ability to just create a .r or .py file, open a REPL from Emacs and start to code interactively. It felt easy and lowered my cognitive load to experiment with the languages and learn them. I think my appreciation of Clojure changed the day I managed to get the same workflow working in many context and it might help many. Goals \u00b6 Ability to start scripting and a repl with your text editor in any folder with low ceremony. Quick start of scripts in Clojure which can be converted into bigger project. Too long don\u2019t read \u00b6 First, insure your text editor support nrepl (emacs, vim, IntelliJ, VS Code and Atom support it) and download the required package to support your Clojure development. Then, two solutions Install clojure, and then for a clojure For super fast startup and for shell scripting you can install babashka. Then start the repl with bb --nrepl-server 1667 Setting up your machines \u00b6 nrepl Brew install clojure, download babhaska. Adding dependencies \u00b6 You can add deps. If you use babashka, it has its own methods for adding dependencies (read here). Generality of the solution \u00b6 So can we use the same process for real projects? Yes. Ironically, I found my solution while working on big projects. How do you start a bigger project? Create deps.edn in the root directory of your project, create your src folder, add the :paths (usually [\"src\"] ) and :deps and you can start organizing your code. This workflow helped me tremendously when coding in ClojureScript. I use shadow-cljs and the typical workflow is to start it on the command line for compiling and watching change of your source code. I spent a bit of time understanding how I could connect Emacs to the REPL ( M-x cider-connect-cljs ) which was different than the typical cider-jack-in function. ClojureScript, other targets and considerations \u00b6 I describe my workflow for writing quick script with Clojure JVM. Obviously, there are alternatives with other costs/benefits attributes. lumo and plank for leveraging the node and the javascript environment. joker, an Clojure implementation in Go. That being said, I know many expert Clojurian have a single REPL process running for weeks, hence the start of a REPL might not matter after some level of expertise. I still like the ability to launch a REPL in any folder, without thinking too much. In some situation, nrepl might be a too high requirement for your project (because the library does a lot under the hood). In this case, look at the socket REPL (insert link). I don\u2019t have a lot of experience with the socket REPL, except that emacs use the inf-clojure mode to interact with it. Steps summary \u00b6 Find a text editor/IDE that supports the nrepl (it should not be that hard). Write a simple command line that can launch a nrepl server in the root directory where you want to work. It can be as easy as calling bb --nrepl-server or clojure -A:nrepl after defining the :nrepl alias in .clojure/deps.edn . Note the port or set it to a fix value. Create a .clj (anywhere) Connect your text editor to the REPL and start sending forms from your file. Once you feel comfortable with this workflow, see how you can adapt it to other situations (e.g. ClojureScript, react native, server repl, server vm). Conclusion \u00b6 The goal of the post is to give you a straightforward plan for kick start repl driven development. You achieve this by having a compatible editor, launching a nrepl server with clojure or bb , connecting your editor to the REPL. I hope this simple workflow will allow to experiment much more with Clojure and have fun with it.

Udemy [core.async] Elements of Clojure \u00b6 Naming \u00b6 There is a difference between the sign (the symbols or letters) and the referent (the thing/value to which the sign refers). Consistency is one of the feature that allow to grow. Precision is a trade-off with generality. synthetic allow precision, natural allows beginners to understand (trade off wit how much to learn before being productive). Idioms \u00b6 Indirection \u00b6 Indirection is the process of separating the how from the what . It useful when answering the question How does it work is answered best with it depends . Reference and conditionals are two tools to perform indirection. Getting the referent from a reference is called dereferencing . Reference are open, while conditional are closed (which could be a feature). Another difference is the order matters in conditional (like cond ). Dispatch happens in two context runtime ( dynamic ) and compile time ( static dispatching). Best to avoid hierarchies. Abstraction should be simplest model that satisfies the context requirements and self consistent. It depends on the context which sets the minimal set of constraints to pay attention to. As such it lives in a bubble/context. Hence, we should ask, what are the assumptions of the code? There are the two distinction for abstraction Principled vs Adaptable.

Blogs \u00b6 Agile is an attitude - Russ Olsen Cognitect [2017] \u00b6 The Monkey wrench of agile is the following: To get the job done you need to focus on the goal and the people who will get you there. There is no magic recipe, no set of practices that will guarantee success You need to be ready to throw away the rule book and bob and weave and flex with whatever comes next. You need to improvise, adapt and overcome. Above all, agile means keeping your eye on the fundamentals: What are the goals? And how are we going to get there?

Talks \u00b6 Maybe not - Rich Hickey [2018] \u00b6 The talk is about clojure.spec and about the optionality in requirements. Static typing proponents will always talks about the benefits of types without ever mentioning the costs. In non breaking changes of API (requiring less, providing more), static typing will break APIs callers. Records in contrast to maps (open sets of keys and values) are PLOP. Because you need to place something in the slot where they contain data, and hence options. Clojure will always forbid to create brittle system with closed specifications. In Clojure, when an field of information (the value of a key in map) in unknown, the key is removed from the map (and avoid keys with nil value). Because if the value is nil , we don\u2019t know if we should be worried if the value is nil or if it is valid. In contrast, if the key is not in the map we can safely ignore it. Data aggregates are herd of information and is moving from one process to another. The solution is to define herd is to split the specifications into two: a schema describing the aggregate (and its tree) and a context whenever in function calls and returns. Specs Leverage/Testing/Custom Generators, Screencast- Stuart Halloway [2016] \u00b6 The advantage are validation, conformance, destructuring, error message, composition, example data generation, assertion, documentation, generative testing, instrumentation. It is about specs. Specs allows to define attributes, composites and function specs. A function specs takes three keys :args , :ret and :fn (which takes the specs as argument). The most interesting is the fn which is describe properties of the function returns. Specs allows to use regular expression on data structure for creating your specs. You can use s/exercise for generating sample of your spec and (test/check `my-fn) and test/summarize-result for checking your function specs. The function s/valid? and s/explain-data allows to validate and to get data for our mistakes. Whenever testing, you also can use test/instrument to instrument your function for better error message. s/alt for alternative, s/and for predicates aggregation, s/or for or predicate composition. Maybe s/& . The function gen/fmap takes a value from a generate and returns a value, while gen/let and gen/bind takes a generator and return a generator. Usually these are wrapped into functions and called with ( s/exercise ::s { ::s wrapper-around-fmap }) ;; or ( s/def ::s ( s/spec pred? :gen wrapper-around-fmap )) Usually, gen/let and gen/bind are used in conjunction with a model for representing the input data. The model acts as generator of test input, helping to conceptualize the expected inputs. For example ( def model ( s/cat :prefix string? :match string? :suffix string? )) when testing a index-of function for string. Write about s/fspec . The trick in using s/fspec is to provide reasonable generators. Using the gen/return allows to wrap a high order function as a generator . Read test.check.generator for more details .

It useful when answering the question How does it work is answered best with it depends . Reference and conditionals are two tools to perform indirection. Getting the referent from a reference is called dereferencing . Reference are open, while conditional are closed (which could be a feature). Another difference is the order matters in conditional (like cond ). Dispatch happens in two context runtime ( dynamic ) and compile time ( static dispatching). Best to avoid hierarchies. Abstraction should be simplest model that satisfies the context requirements and self consistent. It depends on the context which sets the minimal set of constraints to pay attention to. As such it lives in a bubble/context. Hence, we should ask, what are the assumptions of the code? There are the two distinction for abstraction Principled vs Adaptable.
