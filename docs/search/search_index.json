Unquote splicing ~@ allows to remove the parenthesis in a list and put them at the same level as the parent S-Expression. For example the following `(1 2 ~@(3 4) 5)` returns (1 2 3 4 5) .

Disadvantage with macros. Macros are not values (as they are not functions). So we can\u2019t use map or any other function on them. Macros can be contagious as they can leak force your user to also write macros to use your library. They can be tough to get right (mainly because of side effect and computation time). We should avoid doing a mess in our user namespace whenever writing macros. Macros are useful to evaluate code in Context. When using dynamic binding, ( declare ^ :dynamic *radius* ) ( defn circle-area [] ( * Math/PI ( * *radius* *radius* ))) ( binding [ *radius* 10 ] ( circle-area )) it can be useful to abstract the binding step with a macro.

Before optimizing, we should know how to benchmark. criterium.core is a nice solution for that.

It allows to avoid unnecessary intermediary steps for the users to know, especially ones that require forms that are not essentials to the API. For example, building resources or calling functions.

( def new-orders clojure.lang.PersistentQueue/EMPTY ) Use transient and persistent! if the transformation is local. The library medley from weavejester incorporate useful functions. Collection accessing: use keyword first (:key m) , or (m :key) if it is certain that m is a map, otherwise if both might be null use (get m k) . If possible avoid having a stack of left parentheses such as ((f) x) . Abuse of select-keys to subset a map. If performance is required, we can create custom collection by defining a type and implementing the protocol, a custom printing is possible. Use records and maps to describe your entities. Maps should be the default choice, unless you decide to use protocols and need performance for dispatch. Protocols and multimethods are the two ways for dispatching. Protocols are faster in Clojure, but multimethods are more flexible. Processing Sequential Data. \u00b6 We can use map , filter , reduce to process sequence of values, but it might not be efficient. Transducers are created to avoid the concretion of the data structure. A transducer (usually denoted by xf or xform ) is a function that transform a reducing function into an another reducing function. That is xf: f -> g where f and g have signature whatever, input -> whatever . Concrete example of reducing function are conj with whatever being a list, + (with whatever being a number, and input a number). See here for more details. The trick is you can define map, filter and other operations as reducing function (reducing function are used in reduce operations usually). It is important to note that reducing function can actually grow the whatever (see conj ). We create them by omitting the coll argument in the typical sequence functions, e.g. (map f) yields a transducer. Use the sequence function to realize the transducer. The following calls are equal ( = ( map # ( * 2 % ) ( range 10 )) ( sequence ( map # ( * 2 % )) ( range 10 ))) If we need eagerness we could use into ( into [] ( map # ( * 2 % )) ( range 10 )) The benefit of transducer is intermediate values are not allocated and there is a decoupling of the transformations with the reducer (reducing function and reducible collection). They are also polymorphic. We can compose transducers and reduction with transduce ( def moons-transform ( comp ( filter planet? ) ( map :moons ))) ( defn total-moons [ entities ] ( transduce moons-transform + 0 entities )) See understanding transducers for more details. Duplicate removal with distinct and dedupe (only remove subsequent duplicate and safer for large input). Use mapcat instead of (-> map flatten) . Reference, State and Mutation \u00b6 Identity and state are two distinct notions. An identity is a sequence of immutable values, and the state is the actual value of an identity at a certain point of time. The challenge is to always display a single valid value to all the observer at the same time. There are two types of successions (mutation): atomic and transactions. An atomic transaction only cares about the change happening to the identity itself and not about the coordination of other identity. Transactional ensure that either all changes or none are performed. There are two states: program and runtime states. Program state is concerned with mutation in the problem domain, whereas runtime facilitate the software\u2019s execution (e.g. connections to databases or network, config files). Runtime state is often unavoidable whereas program state should be minimized and access through API with curated methods rather than directly. For managing change, we should build just enough to ensure the application\u2019s needs are met. Every side effect and mutable reference slows you down. We should be responsible over our functions (make them pure) and make choices about what need to be managed. State is a series of snapshots of values (data) which allows to act responsibly when considering the presence of observers in other processes. In Clojure, observers have consistent set of values as of a particular instant thanks to Clojure\u2019s mutable references. Use your cores \u00b6 One of the problem is to send task of the main thread to be completed asynchronously and retrieve the result ( future and promise ). Tasks and workers for long lived task-oriented concurrency. We can also use reducers and core.async (with channels and go blocks ). For agents, use send for computational tasks and won\u2019t block for I/O and send-off for updates that might block for an arbitrary time (thread pool will grow accordingly). The advantage is agent can maintain state compared to future . Use deref or @ for retrieving back the value of a future or promise . Promise are used to returns several values from a future block. Use realized? to check if a promise is available, otherwise it will block. The deref function with an additional argument can force timeout. Use Java queues and workers for task oriented programs. This is for coarse grained task parallelism. Queues , threads and executors are the tools from Java to perform a queue of incoming work or requests. For fine-grained parallelism The pmap function can be used for easy parallelism, but the overhead might be consequential. The clojure.core.reducer library is the solution for parallelism [fine-grained operations and memory efficient]. A reducer is reducible collection combined with a reducing function . fold is used to perform the reduction [only vectors and maps can be folded in parallel, but the serial version can be faster thanks to avoiding intermediary values]. A reducer splits the data into partition, reduce the elements and then combine them. The reduce and the combine functions can hence be different. Concurrency (design the program as a set of concurrent threads of execution) we can use core.async . Channels come in unbuffered, fixed buffered, dropping (discard new data) and sliding buffer (discard old data). Creating a channel is done with chan the function. nil can not be passed into channels (as it is the value for saying the channel is closed). The important operations are put and take . A full channel (once the buffer is complete) blocks a thread if no process other process is the other end of the channel to take the value sent by put . Backpressure is the efffect that fixed sized buffers creates by making the producers block when trying to add to a full queue. Traditionally channels are used in go block . In the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), process belongs to a thread pool and are parked when not blocked by a channel operation ( >! or <! ). Go blocks are great for building pipelines of data transformation. core.async/pipelines gives up the raw performance of fine-grained data parallelism but yield a more flexible architecture. The function moves the value from input to output channel with parallel transducer execution. Next step is to break a growing system into pieces using concurrency. Designing components \u00b6 Use of channels, better to receive and provide channels for interface. In core.async , a single go block is to call the body of the go block once asynchronously, while go-loop is intended for looping, unless we close the channel. go blocks return a channel, which can be used for pedestal. A good design is to split an API layer and implementation layer with a record. As for core.async , there are three additional concept for channels that are useful: pipeline, fan-in and fan-out. In a system, pipelines link an output channel to an input channel (acting like as a conveyor belt) and can possibly transform its input values with a transducer (async, sync, blocking). The pipe function should be used when no transformation. Fan-in channels gather the input of several channels and provide a single output channel. merge is a simple way to merge all the incoming channels into a single output channels, but it can\u2019t be modified after creation. The mix (for audio mix) function with its functions admix/unmix allows channel to participate in the mix. Users can toggle options for each input channel: :pause (no consumption nor inclusion in output channel), :mute (consumption but no inclusion), :solo ( if true, only solo-ed channels in output channel mix, :pause and :mute ignored if this is the case). Fan-out have three ways: mult , pub/sub , split . The mult abstraction is multiply traffic from the input channel into multiple output channels. Output channels (with different blocking policy) can participate in the connection with tap/untap (if a tap is closed, it is removed from the mult ). All the receiving channels must accept a value from the mult before the mult can move on to the next value. This is where alternative buffering strategy are useful. The pub/sub allows to distribute the traffic through a partition function and subscribers can inform to which partition value they want to lisen to. split divides the traffic two channels based on a truthiness of a predicate. split is actually a pub/sub with a partition function providing only truthy/falsy . Compose Your Application \u00b6 Taking things apart: usualy some portion of the code will work on the same data, or have the data has a common scope or lifetime, likelihehood of change from external requirement is similar are resource needed. If code is reusable when configured differently in more than one context, then it is a component. Component should communicate with channels, but in order to set up the system correctly, we need something to orchestrate it. Several library exist, the book recommends Component , but it has been super-seeded by integrant . An example can be found here reitit/integrant . Environment variable also should exist with different settings. The solution in the book are a bit old. Environ still seems to be good on clojure (jvm). Testing \u00b6 There are three ways to create tests in clojure: repl, example based, generative testing (properties check). With REPL driven development, the example used for development are stored in a file (these are candidates for examples). For example based, there is the expectations library and the following snippets ( deftest test-range-are ( testing \"Testing range(endIndex)\" ( are [ expected endIndexf ( = expected ( range endIndex )) ' ( 0 1 2 3 4 ) 5 ' () 0 ]))) Generative testing using ( ns generative-testing.core ( :require [ clojure.test.check :as tc ] [ clojure.test.check.generators :as gen ] [ clojure.test.check.properties :as prop ])) I think nowadays we would use spec for it. We are looking for invariants \u2013 properties that are always true. [\u2026] mathematical laws, relationships between inputs and outputs, round-trip or complementing functions, and comparing action effects. Properties like identity, associativity, commutativity and idempotency are an excellent place to start. Invariants are important because they reduce the number of case your code must consider. Thinking in Clojure \u00b6 Make Reasoned Choices: always compare trade-off of solutions (benefits and costs). Think first, then do . Careful treatment of decisions and weighed trade-off to fully understand the consequences. Be Reasonable: code with clearly expressed intent, limited side effects, neatly separated concerns, and unambiguous naming. Simple. Keep It Simple: Keep distinct concern as distinct as possible and avoid entangling concepts with other concepts. The code can be reasoned about, test and implemented without any incidental complexity. Entities are simplest when distinct and composable. Domain functions avoid complexity by avoiding side effects and concerning themselves only with entities in their domain. Build Just Enough: Keep complexity at bay and avoid overengineering. Compose: compose component, and evaluate your code composability by using it from another component. Results will be a set of tidy interfaces to distinct independent subsystems with clear communication channels. With a stable interface, a component can grow easily and adapt quickly. Be Precise: avoid ambiguity and communicate clearly with others and your future self. Entities typify one concept. Functions effect a single transformation. Queries ask simple questions and return unambiguous results. Use What Works: look for working libraries, solution in other languages or papers.

Deadlock: On a table, every one has to take the left and right stick and the same time. However, there is only one stick per person. Leading to a deadlock. Solutions to these are future (new thread), delay (like future but executed only at deref time), promise (empty memory location shared to all thread that will receive value only once with deliver ). The advantage is all the execution are cached. Note : deference is done with either the defer function or the @ sign in front of the variable. References type :concurrency:epochal_time_model: \u00b6 atom are identities that can be set and shared by multiple threads. They use a set and compare algorithm, i.e. the swap! function modifies the value of the atom variable only if its values did not change between the beginning and the end of the transaction. swap! and reset! are the main function to work with atoms. watch are function with four arguments: a key (a keyword for identifying the process calling the watcher), a reference variable being watched, the old-state, and the new state. ( defn f [ key watched old-state new-state ] nil ) A watcher function is attached to a reference type (e.g an atom) with the add-watch function having the following signature: ( def counter ( atom 0 )) ( add-watch counter :watching-counter watch-fn ) Validators are functions that can check if new states are valid. They take as argument the atom and return a boolean. They are added to the atom as follow ( defn bigger-than-1 [ x ] ( or ( > x 1 ) ( throw ( IllegalStateException. \"That's too small\" )))) ( def account ( atom 2 :validator bigger-than-1 )) ( swap! account inc ) ( swap! account - 10 ) ;; Throw an error ref type are the ACI in the ACID accronym (atomic, consistent and isolated) and use STM . It means that either the operations between two refs happened correctly, or the transaction is aborted. alter and dosync are the key functions. In a transaction (that is the body of dosync ), every ref keep their state to the transaction (invisible to outside threads) and when the transaction tries to commit, every ref checks if the value has been altered by other threads. If any of them has been change, then none of the ref are updated, and the transaction restart with the new value and commits only when the initial states has not been /alter/ed by other processes. commute also allow to change the state of a ref. However, at transaction time, if ref states have been altered, only the commute part is run again with the new states, which might lead to inconsistent state, but increased performance. ensure function protects refs from being modified by other transaction. This is helpful, when a transaction must modify only one refs, but the other related refs must not be altered by other transaction. 5. vars are associations between symbols and objects. ^:dynamic is a keyword in def to signal to clojure that a vars is dynamic. Varnames are enclosed around * (e.g. *user-email* ) to show to other programmers that the variable is dynamic. bindings is a dynamic let . Dynamic vars are often use to name a resource that one ore more functions target. set! allows to change the state of the dynamic vars. alter-var-root allows to rebind a immutable vars (which is unadvised), and with-redefs allows to create local binding for testing. 6. pmap and the following ppmap can be used to execute parallel task: ( defn ppmap \"Partitioned pmap, for grouping map ops together to make parallel overehead worthwile\" [ grain-size f & colls ] ( apply concat ( apply pmap ( fn [ & pgroups ] ( doall ( apply map f pgroups ))) ( map ( partial partition-all grain-size ) colls )))) core.async and channels :core_async: \u00b6 chan creates a channel. And channel communicate through messages . One can put and take message. Processes wait for completion of their message. Process: Wait and do nothing until successful completion of either put or take from a channel. After success of the operation, continue. go and their blocks ( go blocks ) runs separately on a concurrent thread. go creates a process (i.e. its go block), which runs a pool of threads equal two plus the number of machines cores (avoiding the overhead of creating threads). Each go block only live until it reach the ends of its body. <! and <!! are the take function. It listen to the channel and wait until an another process puts a value in the channel which the take function returns. >! and >!! are the put function which always return true. It provides a message to a channel and wait until the message to be taken by another process before releasing resources. The number of ! in the operation depends if one is inside a go block (one ! ) or not (two ! ). Blocking and parking waiting are key to understand the number of ! . Parking wait allows a thread to handle several process (and this is only possible in a go block ). When one of the process starts to wait, the thread put it aside and starts an another process until it starts to wait, and so on. Use poll! and offer! to have non blocking channel interactions in the REPL. Channel buffers are created as following: ( def buffer-size 2 ) ( def channel-buffer ( chan buffer-size )) This means we can create 2 values without waiting for a response. sliding-buffer (FIFO) and dropping-buffer (LIFO) can be used to discard channel message without blocking. 5. close! closes channel. A closed channel does not accept any puts anymore and after all the values have been retrieved, the subsequent takes return nil . 6. alts!! lets us use the result of the first successful channel operation among a collection of channel operations. The elegant solution with alts!! is one can define a timeout ( let [[ message channel ] ( alts!! [ c1 c2 ( timout 20 )])] ;; c1 and c2 are predefined channels. ( println message )) if the timeout is the first to finish than message is nil . See alt! macro as well. 7. Queues and pipelines (escaping the callback hell) are common patterns. Abstraction and polymorphism \u00b6 Multimethods ( defmulti method-name ( fn [ x ] ( :type x ))) ;; or simplty :type, can be more complicated as well ( defmethod method-name :hello [ x ] \"Hello\" ) ( defmethod method-name :good-bye [ x ] \"Good-bye\" ) ( defmethod method-name :default [ x ] \"I don't know you\" ) ( method-name { :type :hello }) ; => Hello ( method-name { :type :good-bye }) ; Good-bye ( method-name { :type :what? }) ; => I don't know you One can also create hierarchies with derive and namespace keywords. 2. A protocol allows to make dispatch by the type of the first argument and it is a collection of polymorphic operations (unlike multimethod which is just one function). Methods from protocols can not have a & rest argument. Key functions are defprotocol , extend-type , extend-protocol (for specifying for several type at once). - Caveat: methods from protocols are property of the namespace and not from the object. 3. Records are extension of hash-map . ( defrecord WereWolf [ name title ]) ( WereWolf. \"David\" \"Master\" ) ( ->WereWolf \"David\" \"Master\" ) ( map->WereWolf { :name \"David\" :title \"Master\" }) On has to use the :import: statement in the ns macro in order to import records. One can access field through the keyword or the dot . macro. ( .name ( WereWolf. \"David\" \"Master\" )) ; \"David\" ( :title ( WereWolf. \"David\" \"Master\" )) ; \"Master\" Any function on map works on record (although they do not retain their class if one dissoc or assoc them). Here is how one could extend a protocol. ( defprotocol WereCreature \"Awesom Were\" ( full-moon-behavior [ x ] \"Full-moon behavior\" )) ( defrecord WereWolf [ name title ] WereCreature ( full-moon-behavior [ x ] ( str name \" will kill everyone\" ))) ( full-moon-behavior ( WereWolf. \"David\" \"Master\" )) deftype , reify , proxy . reify is about implementing an anonymous protocol at runtime.

They use a set and compare algorithm, i.e. the swap! function modifies the value of the atom variable only if its values did not change between the beginning and the end of the transaction. swap! and reset! are the main function to work with atoms. watch are function with four arguments: a key (a keyword for identifying the process calling the watcher), a reference variable being watched, the old-state, and the new state. ( defn f [ key watched old-state new-state ] nil ) A watcher function is attached to a reference type (e.g an atom) with the add-watch function having the following signature: ( def counter ( atom 0 )) ( add-watch counter :watching-counter watch-fn ) Validators are functions that can check if new states are valid. They take as argument the atom and return a boolean. They are added to the atom as follow ( defn bigger-than-1 [ x ] ( or ( > x 1 ) ( throw ( IllegalStateException. \"That's too small\" )))) ( def account ( atom 2 :validator bigger-than-1 )) ( swap! account inc ) ( swap! account - 10 ) ;; Throw an error ref type are the ACI in the ACID accronym (atomic, consistent and isolated) and use STM . It means that either the operations between two refs happened correctly, or the transaction is aborted. alter and dosync are the key functions. In a transaction (that is the body of dosync ), every ref keep their state to the transaction (invisible to outside threads) and when the transaction tries to commit, every ref checks if the value has been altered by other threads. If any of them has been change, then none of the ref are updated, and the transaction restart with the new value and commits only when the initial states has not been /alter/ed by other processes. commute also allow to change the state of a ref. However, at transaction time, if ref states have been altered, only the commute part is run again with the new states, which might lead to inconsistent state, but increased performance. ensure function protects refs from being modified by other transaction. This is helpful, when a transaction must modify only one refs, but the other related refs must not be altered by other transaction. 5. vars are associations between symbols and objects. ^:dynamic is a keyword in def to signal to clojure that a vars is dynamic. Varnames are enclosed around * (e.g. *user-email* ) to show to other programmers that the variable is dynamic. bindings is a dynamic let . Dynamic vars are often use to name a resource that one ore more functions target. set! allows to change the state of the dynamic vars. alter-var-root allows to rebind a immutable vars (which is unadvised), and with-redefs allows to create local binding for testing. 6. pmap and the following ppmap can be used to execute parallel task: ( defn ppmap \"Partitioned pmap, for grouping map ops together to make parallel overehead worthwile\" [ grain-size f & colls ] ( apply concat ( apply pmap ( fn [ & pgroups ] ( doall ( apply map f pgroups ))) ( map ( partial partition-all grain-size ) colls ))))","title":"References type     :concurrency:epochal_time_model:"},{"location":"cards/20200430160432-clojure_for_the_brave_and_the_true/#coreasync-and-channels-core_async","text":"chan creates a channel.

It listen to the channel and wait until an another process puts a value in the channel which the take function returns. >! and >!! are the put function which always return true. It provides a message to a channel and wait until the message to be taken by another process before releasing resources. The number of ! in the operation depends if one is inside a go block (one ! ) or not (two ! ). Blocking and parking waiting are key to understand the number of ! . Parking wait allows a thread to handle several process (and this is only possible in a go block ).

When you understand a tool\u2019s purpose, your brain gets loaded with helpful contextual details that make it easier for you to assimilate new knowledge. It\u2019s like working on a puzzle: when you\u2019re able to look at a picture of the completed puzzle, it\u2019s a lot easier to fit the pieces together. A tool\u2019s external model is the interface it presents and the way it wants you to think about problem solving. Clojure\u2019s external model is a Lisp that wants you to think about programming as mostly data-centric, immutable transformations. You\u2019ll soon see that Ansible wants you to think of server provisioning in terms of defining the end state, rather than defining the steps you should take to get to that state. A tool\u2019s internal model is how it transforms the inputs to its interface into some lower-level abstraction. Clojure transforms Lisp into JVM bytecode. Ansible transforms task definitions into shell commands. In an ideal world, you wouldn\u2019t have to understand the internal model, but in reality it\u2019s almost always helpful to understand a tool\u2019s internal model because it gives you a unified perspective on what might seem like confusing or contradictory parts.

Udemy [core.async] Elements of Clojure \u00b6 Naming \u00b6 There is a difference between the sign (the symbols or letters) and the referent (the thing/value to which the sign refers). Consistency is one of the feature that allow to grow. Precision is a trade-off with generality. synthetic allow precision, natural allows beginners to understand (trade off wit how much to learn before being productive). Idioms \u00b6 Indirection \u00b6 Indirection is the process of separating the how from the what . It useful when answering the question How does it work is answered best with it depends . Reference and conditionals are two tools to perform indirection. Getting the referent from a reference is called dereferencing . Reference are open, while conditional are closed (which could be a feature). Another difference is the order matters in conditional (like cond ). Dispatch happens in two context runtime ( dynamic ) and compile time ( static dispatching). Best to avoid hierarchies. Abstraction should be simplest model that satisfies the context requirements and self consistent. It depends on the context which sets the minimal set of constraints to pay attention to. As such it lives in a bubble/context. Hence, we should ask, what are the assumptions of the code? There are the two distinction for abstraction Principled vs Adaptable. Principled allows to create big architecture artifacts, but they are not adaptable (castle cards or sky scrapper, changing a room are hard). We should thrive for complex adaptable network, that is small components that are principled but in an adaptable network (pieces can be removed and substituted). How to gather code to create principled component? If code have the same set of assumption, then good place to gather them. Change is constant. Blogs \u00b6 Agile is an attitude - Russ Olsen Cognitect [2017] \u00b6 The Monkey wrench of agile is the following: To get the job done you need to focus on the goal and the people who will get you there. There is no magic recipe, no set of practices that will guarantee success You need to be ready to throw away the rule book and bob and weave and flex with whatever comes next. You need to improvise, adapt and overcome. Above all, agile means keeping your eye on the fundamentals: What are the goals? And how are we going to get there? You need to be ready to throw away the rule book and bob and weave and flex with whatever comes next. You need to improvise, adapt and overcome . Above all, agile means keeping your eye on the fundamentals: What are the goals? And how are we going to get there? . You need to improvise, adapt and overcome. What are the goals, and how are we going to get there? When agile processes make sense, use them. When they don\u2019t, let them go without regret. Iteration Zero - Naoko Higashide Cognitect [2017] \u00b6 The framework is about people first, conversations, realizations, and shared understanding. Bring people who will participate (not attend). First is to define responsibilities. will for . Finishing lines. The project will be complete when\u2026 Winning condition. Of the following choose three and describe: Schedule Scope Quality Budget Customer Satisfaction Teamwork / Learning Make sure that project\u2019s sponsor is aligned with those of the team. Talks \u00b6 Maybe not - Rich Hickey [2018] \u00b6 The talk is about clojure.spec and about the optionality in requirements. Static typing proponents will always talks about the benefits of types without ever mentioning the costs. In non breaking changes of API (requiring less, providing more), static typing will break APIs callers. Records in contrast to maps (open sets of keys and values) are PLOP. Because you need to place something in the slot where they contain data, and hence options. Clojure will always forbid to create brittle system with closed specifications. In Clojure, when an field of information (the value of a key in map) in unknown, the key is removed from the map (and avoid keys with nil value). Because if the value is nil , we don\u2019t know if we should be worried if the value is nil or if it is valid. In contrast, if the key is not in the map we can safely ignore it. Data aggregates are herd of information and is moving from one process to another. The solution is to define herd is to split the specifications into two: a schema describing the aggregate (and its tree) and a context whenever in function calls and returns. Specs Leverage/Testing/Custom Generators, Screencast- Stuart Halloway [2016] \u00b6 The advantage are validation, conformance, destructuring, error message, composition, example data generation, assertion, documentation, generative testing, instrumentation. It is about specs. Specs allows to define attributes, composites and function specs. A function specs takes three keys :args , :ret and :fn (which takes the specs as argument). The most interesting is the fn which is describe properties of the function returns. Specs allows to use regular expression on data structure for creating your specs. You can use s/exercise for generating sample of your spec and (test/check `my-fn) and test/summarize-result for checking your function specs. The function s/valid? and s/explain-data allows to validate and to get data for our mistakes. Whenever testing, you also can use test/instrument to instrument your function for better error message. s/alt for alternative, s/and for predicates aggregation, s/or for or predicate composition. Maybe s/& . The function gen/fmap takes a value from a generate and returns a value, while gen/let and gen/bind takes a generator and return a generator. Usually these are wrapped into functions and called with ( s/exercise ::s { ::s wrapper-around-fmap }) ;; or ( s/def ::s ( s/spec pred? :gen wrapper-around-fmap )) Usually, gen/let and gen/bind are used in conjunction with a model for representing the input data. The model acts as generator of test input, helping to conceptualize the expected inputs. For example ( def model ( s/cat :prefix string? :match string? :suffix string? )) when testing a index-of function for string. Write about s/fspec . The trick in using s/fspec is to provide reasonable generators. Using the gen/return allows to wrap a high order function as a generator . Read test.check.generator for more details .

We should thrive for complex adaptable network, that is small components that are principled but in an adaptable network (pieces can be removed and substituted). How to gather code to create principled component? If code have the same set of assumption, then good place to gather them.

Static typing proponents will always talks about the benefits of types without ever mentioning the costs. In non breaking changes of API (requiring less, providing more), static typing will break APIs callers. Records in contrast to maps (open sets of keys and values) are PLOP. Because you need to place something in the slot where they contain data, and hence options. Clojure will always forbid to create brittle system with closed specifications. In Clojure, when an field of information (the value of a key in map) in unknown, the key is removed from the map (and avoid keys with nil value). Because if the value is nil , we don\u2019t know if we should be worried if the value is nil or if it is valid. In contrast, if the key is not in the map we can safely ignore it. Data aggregates are herd of information and is moving from one process to another. The solution is to define herd is to split the specifications into two: a schema describing the aggregate (and its tree) and a context whenever in function calls and returns.","title":"Maybe not - Rich Hickey [2018]"},{"location":"decks/clojure/#specs-leveragetestingcustom-generators-screencast-stuart-halloway-2016","text":"The advantage are validation, conformance, destructuring, error message, composition, example data generation, assertion, documentation, generative testing, instrumentation. It is about specs. Specs allows to define attributes, composites and function specs. A function specs takes three keys :args , :ret and :fn (which takes the specs as argument). The most interesting is the fn which is describe properties of the function returns. Specs allows to use regular expression on data structure for creating your specs. You can use s/exercise for generating sample of your spec and (test/check `my-fn) and test/summarize-result for checking your function specs. The function s/valid? and s/explain-data allows to validate and to get data for our mistakes. Whenever testing, you also can use test/instrument to instrument your function for better error message. s/alt for alternative, s/and for predicates aggregation, s/or for or predicate composition. Maybe s/& . The function gen/fmap takes a value from a generate and returns a value, while gen/let and gen/bind takes a generator and return a generator. Usually these are wrapped into functions and called with ( s/exercise ::s { ::s wrapper-around-fmap }) ;; or ( s/def ::s ( s/spec pred? :gen wrapper-around-fmap )) Usually, gen/let and gen/bind are used in conjunction with a model for representing the input data. The model acts as generator of test input, helping to conceptualize the expected inputs. For example ( def model ( s/cat :prefix string? :match string? :suffix string? )) when testing a index-of function for string. Write about s/fspec . The trick in using s/fspec is to provide reasonable generators. Using the gen/return allows to wrap a high order function as a generator .
